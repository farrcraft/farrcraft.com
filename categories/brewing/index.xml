With that out of the way, we can focus on wiring up the remaining hardware components. There will be two types of IO devices wired to the Pi – temperature sensors and SSR’s.
Temperature Sensors The temperature sensors being used are small digital thermometers which communicate using the Dallas 1-wire network protocol.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Fermentation Controller – Part 2</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2013/04/24/raspberry-pi-fermentation-controller-part-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2013/04/24/raspberry-pi-fermentation-controller-part-2/</guid><description>In part 1 I walked through getting the Raspberry Pi initially up and running. Once you’re logged in, you can immediately start hooking up sensors and start polling them directly from the command line. However, you’re likely going to want some more software installed for additional tasks. For my fermentation controller, I’ve decided on the following software stack.
Software Stack Graphite StatsD Node.js MongoDB All of the data read from sensors along with GPIO state changes will all be recorded in Graphite.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Fermentation Controller – Part 1</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2013/04/20/raspberry-pi-fermentation-controller-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2013/04/20/raspberry-pi-fermentation-controller-part-1/</guid><description>The Raspberry Pi is a cheap single-board computer with generic IO features which make it ideal for brewery automation projects. The BrewPi project is just one example. I decided to assemble a similar project with the goal of being able to monitor, log, and control the fermentation temperature of two 5-6 gallon carboys of fermenting beer.
