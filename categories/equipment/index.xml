Shipping was fast and the box was a bit beat up when I got it. It probably could have been packaged a little better, but it&amp;rsquo;s a big chunk of steel - it&amp;rsquo;d take quite a beating to do any damage to it.
Parts disassembled.</description></item><item><title>Backyard Brewery v2.0</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2016/07/23/backyard-brewery-v2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 06:16:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2016/07/23/backyard-brewery-v2/</guid><description>This is a portion of my old propane-fired homebrewing setup for 5 gallon batches.

Measuring, monitoring and ultimately, controlling temperature is a key aspect of producing quality beer. It starts with making sure that the water is being heated to the correct temperature for mashing and later on for sparging. It continues with gettingÂ the boiled wort cooled down to an appropriate temperature to pitch the yeast. After fermentation and carbonation, the beer needs to be cooled down to the correct serving temperature.</description></item></channel></rss>
