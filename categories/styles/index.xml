Styles are primarily defined by characteristics such as color, bitterness, alcohol content, ingredients, aroma, body, mouthfeel and flavor. They also often carry particular historical and regional significance. For instance, the Berliner Weisse began as a regional specialty style of Berlin while Munich Helles was first created in Munich.
While beers have probably been categorized into different styles based on their differing properties for as long as they have been brewed, it is possibly the acclaimed English beer writer Michael Jackson who pioneered modern beer style definitions with his 1977 book “The World Guide To Beer”.</description></item></channel></rss>
