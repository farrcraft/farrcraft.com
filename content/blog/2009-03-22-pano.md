Less than a mile’s walk from my front door are the Buena Vista and Corona Heights parks. Albeit, a mile of steep hill climbing, the views of the city from the top are well worth it. I’ve recently created a few panoramas from photos taken at these locations. Hopefully they give a sense of the expansive city scenery below. Each image is linked to the full resolution version.

This image was merged from two shots taken from a street corner on Buena Vista East. It was my first attempt with using Photoshop’s Photomerge command. That it worked out for a panorama was a happy accident. They weren’t intended as such and one half was shot using a slightly longer shutter speed. It only seemed obvious that the two shots be combined after downloading and viewing the images later.

This image was combined from 8 shots taken from Corona Heights Park. This time I shot with the intent of stitching the source photos together. However, I’m still shooting handheld without any tripod assistance.

Slightly closer to the summit, this 26k pixel wide photo was merged from an excessive sequence of 33 shots. Precariously perched on a steep slope and buffeted by gusty winds I quickly scanned across roughly 180 degrees of the horizon, snapping a quick sequence for this composition. Even with the large number of uneven handheld shots, Photoshop managed to create a decent stitch. The original combined .psb file weighed in at approximately 2.2gb (normal Photoshop files use the .psd format.  
However, once images reach ridiculous sizes, they must use this format instead. SB is for Super Big.)
