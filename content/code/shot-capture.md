Shot Capture is a tool designed to remotely control a DSLR camera and record single hi-resolution RAW images to disk. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a motion controller rig. The recorded images can later be processed and combined to create HD video sequences. [Github Repo](https://github.com/farrcraft/shot-capture)
