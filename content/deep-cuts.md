Welcome to the deep cuts. Over 2+ decades, you develop some portfolio cruft. These are some of the bits and bobs that I've toiled and tinkered with over the years. There are some outdated and ocasionally cringeworthy technology choices, but also some bits that I'm really proud of for what they were at the time.

## Personal Projects

These are all projects I have worked on in my spare time for myself (such as this website), friends, or as learning experiences.

### quantumfish.com

The original http://www.quantumfish.com website ran a lightweight custom-built MVC framework written in PHP. It originally used ADOdb for database connectivity. The final version provided database access using QCubed’s ORM system implemented as a framework plugin. The next iteration of this website was built using the Octopress blogging framework.

### bottletheory.com
This project extends on concepts explored in the original tQF website and Basil application frameworks along with ideas based on various other project research. The genesis began as a conversation among friends in September 2009 about a hypothetical application that could be used as a tool to track and log information about the various beers a person had tried. This original concept has slowly developed into the basis for a social game platform with a feature set including lists, check ins, and achievements. It represents the culmination of my current ideas and best practices in building a modern social web platform &#8211; It is truly for the love of beer and web technology. Among the components it leverages, LAMP, Amazon Web Services, Lucene/Solr, ActiveMQ, Doctrine ORM, Zend Framework, jQuery AJAX, REST JSON services.

### darkclown.com

For darkclown.com I provided the layout and design for the PHP-Nuke based CMS. I also managed the hosting and applied updates as they became available.

### clanversus.com

Over the years I have provided several site layouts for the ClanVersus gaming group website, built a complete modular portal/CMS from scratch, managed site hosting, and provided software upgrades to the highly customized phpbb based forums and mediawiki installation.

### sermons.quantumfish.com
This was my first blog site. It ran on PyBlosxom with content mostly related to Gentoo GNU/Linux topics.

## CTA Work

My work at CTA had me building websites that were for the most part targeted at freight transportation needs. A few, such as lhptransport.com and ctatechs.com were primarily static design jobs. Most, however, were complex web applications powered by a LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) stack.

|This was a simple static corporate website. I provided all of the site layout and design. The HTML and CSS were hand coded with a small amount of PHP on the backend utilized for the common header, footer, and navigation elements. The original content was largely MS Office generated and required a good deal of hand reformatting to be standards comformant.|This site was a complex web application designed to be used in the transportation logistics industry. Its initial purpose was to help match LTL truck carriers with available loads from shippers. Over the course of the development a number of other useful tools were added. The project also became the base code for several sister sites including Prime, Inc.’s customized version and the commercial version available through LoadMax.com.|

|This was a sister site based on the original with some additional features:<br> - 3rd party data integrations for retrieving, parsing, and importing EDI formatted data from AS400 mainframes for website display; fetching LTL rates from Linux network service utilizing a XML-RPC middleware solution|This was a commercial version of the original loadmover.com application. Some features included: Building custom Bill of Lading forms and generating printable PDF document versions on the fly; Advanced search capabilities including complex distance and radius location calculations; Customizable automated search agents providing specific matches via email|

The tools included data management for trucks, loads, and contacts for each agent. Data could be imported/exported from MS Excel via common CSV type formats. A document storage system for managing images of scanned documents such as Bill of Lading forms was also incorporated into the system. User access was controlled through a detailed ACL framework.|
|![transbids](/uploads/2015/07/transbids.jpg)|![dats](/uploads/2015/07/dats.jpg)|
|The Transbids.com project was meant to provide a system for logistics companies to easily complete bid proposals on lanes provided by shippers (e.g. Kodak, Pepsi, Quaker). The system would function similar to a auction or RFP type tool, automating winning bid selections.|The dats.us website was designed to become a directory of transportation industry service providers with a focus on minority owned businesses.|

## F&H Projects

These projects included building and supporting the external customer-facing websites as well as implementing intranet systems for document management, and designing materials for print (logos, brochures, business cards).

![scootinscooters](/uploads/2015/07/scootinscooters.jpg)

### scootinscooters.com

This was a standard business website with a few dynamic features such as a product catalog, product registration forms, and dealer locators. I also did the design and layout for the site.

## Jesscom Work
As the lead web developer at Jesscom.net I was involved with the development of dozens of sites. The projects ranged from simple static brochure type designs to full portals with complex backend systems and multiple integrative components. Most of the backend development was done with ColdFusion and MS SQL.

### e1051.fm + hot1067.com + rockthis.com + kncycountry.com

These were portal websites for several local/regional radio stations owned by the parent company. While layout and design were handled by our in-house web design staff, I provided all of the backend code for dynamic content generation as well as front-end AJAX-style JavaScript programming. These sites also incorporated real-time information about songs currently being played on-air. This required additional network (Windows/Service/C++) application programming in order to extract the data from the studio tracking software and import it into the website backend.

### dare2care.net + kcdare2care.com
The Dare2Care sites were local charity / volunteer sites supported by our parent company. I implemented the features allowing organizations to post about volunteering opportunities and for volunteers to search that information.

### 417jobline.com + careersinfood.com

These were local job posting boards for which I implemented all of the basic features you would typically find on most employment targetted websites.

## The Others

There are a number of other sites that I also facilitated the development of in some minor capacity. This is a collection of screenshots from a few of those sites.

## Game Dev Code

![mos](/uploads/2015/07/mos.jpg)|

### Minions of Steel
This is an independent RTS (with some FPS elements mixed in) game project which I contributed some coding work on (porting from Ogre 1.2 to 1.4, level/scene loading, input handling, collision detection, camera controls, etc). It is built on the Ogre3D game engine and uses a number of other components such as OIS for input, CEGUI for UI support, tinyxml for XML parsing, et al.

### Particles

A particle system demo.

### Mesh Loaders

A 3D File Format Loader demo.

### SuperMassive

A UT2004 mod consisting of a random assortment of UnrealScript classes for testing out new ideas.<


### Meerkat
A small UT2004 mod. This is an UnrealScript-only modification that adds a new DM gametype with a new starting weapon. The weapon fires targetting beacons and target seeking rockets.

### Caravan of Mastodons
A tiny UT2004 mod. This modification creates a new main menu screen with a custom background image and a map list selection box.

### Linux Shell
A tiny test command shell built on GNU/Linux.<br /> <a href="http://quantumfish.com/files/shell.cxx">download</a>


### Particle Demo 1.4

This is my original OpenGL game engine demo project. This release is based on approximately 15K lines of object-oriented C++ implementing some basic game engine features such as tga texture loading, 2D fonts, a particle system, command console, multitextured skybox, Quake 2 and Milkshape 3D model loading, scene antialiasing, and a command/event binding system.
