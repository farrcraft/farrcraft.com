# 52 Weeks of Cooking

There is a sub-reddit called [r/52weeksofcooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/) that provides a cooking prompt each week.  (There is one specifically for [baking](https://reddit.com/r/52weeksofbaking) too).  The prompts can be specific ingredients, techniques, cuisines, or other inspirations.  While I don't partipate in the social media aspect, I've followed the prompts off and on over the years.  I've found it's a fun and challenging way to keep pushing myself to continue practicing, learning, and trying new things in the kitchen.
