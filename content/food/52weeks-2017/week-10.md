Tahini sauce.This is the recipe I started from: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/israeli-style-extra-smooth-hummus-recipe.html

I used desi chickpeas which have a much darker color than normal chickpeas.  Blended up they resemble a chocolate pudding.

Final hummus blend after combining chickpea puree and tahini sauce.

Bonus - pita bread.

Using a tortilla press to make the pitas.

Baked pita bread.
