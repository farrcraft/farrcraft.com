Individual pot pies - one veggie only and one with chicken.
Crust is just a simple pie dough - flour, butter, salt, water mixed in the food processor and rolled out.
Baked the pies in the oven for about 25 minutes at 375F.

Started the filling by sauteing chopped onion, carrot, celery, garlic and thyme.

Next is the sauce. Start with oil and flour to make a roux and then add the broth.  Since I'm doing a vegetarian option, I'm using a vegetarian broth.

Seasoned with a dash of file powder, salt, and pepper. (Secret ingredient - a splash of red wine vinegar) Sauce is ready to go.

Combine with the sauteed vegetables and mix in some more frozen vegetables - corn, green beans, and peas.

Sous vide chicken breast tenders. 90 minutes at 140F.

Shred the chicken and mix it in with the rest of the filling.

Pies assembled in small oven-safe ramekin dishes and ready to bake.
