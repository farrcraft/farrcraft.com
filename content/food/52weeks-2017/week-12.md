Once upon a time when I lived in a dorm, there were Subway Sundays.  It was a 2 for 1 deal or some such so I'd get a couple of fully loaded meatball subs to last me for a few meals.  Attempted to recreate a homemade version here.  Tried this bread recipe: https://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/subway-bread/ and just kind of winged a basic meatball and marinara recipe.
