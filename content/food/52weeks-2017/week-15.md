    - title: Onion gravy. It hardly gets mentioned, but it is the real star of this dish.  Start with sliced onion, butter, and a bay leaf.

    - title: Cook down the onions & then sprinkle in flour.  You're basically just making an onion roux.  Add some stock and you've got your gravy.

Recipe roughly from - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/bangers-and-mash-with-onion-gravy-recipe.html
Didn't have regular milk for the potatoes.  Used leftover buttermilk from last week's fried chicken plus a splash of soy milk.  Creamy mash with a mild tang from the  buttermilk.  And that. Onion. Gravy.
