Recipe roughly from - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/bangers-and-mash-with-onion-gravy-recipe.html
Didn't have regular milk for the potatoes.  Used leftover buttermilk from last week's fried chicken plus a splash of soy milk.  Creamy mash with a mild tang from the  buttermilk.  And that. Onion. Gravy.

Cooked and drained cubed russets and butter ready to mash.

Mash

Onion gravy. It hardly gets mentioned, but it is the real star of this dish.  Start with sliced onion, butter, and a bay leaf.

Cook down the onions & then sprinkle in flour.  You're basically just making an onion roux.  Add some stock and you've got your gravy.
