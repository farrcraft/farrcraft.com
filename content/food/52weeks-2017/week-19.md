    - title: Wings on a wire rack over the wok with the smoking tea blend all sort of sealed up in aluminum foil.  It's not a perfectly air tight seal.  Fans and open windows are critical.

    - title: I omitted the chili flakes called for and used this chili infused honey instead.  75% of the called for honey was from this bottle.  The rest was a normal clover honey.

I used this recipe: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/tea-smoked-chicken-wings.html
Didn't have any scallions handy, so I used cilantro for garnish instead.  I was surprised at how strongly the smoked tea flavor came  through even with the sauce.  They were really good with a really unique flavor, but for the hassle of all of the smoke in the kitchen, I doubt I'd do this again outside of a special occasion.

I have one of those awful under oven broiler drawers and did around 5 minutes on each side to finish before tossing in the remaining sauce.
