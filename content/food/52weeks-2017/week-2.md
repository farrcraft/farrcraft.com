    - title: Toast some long grain rice in oil.  Short grain would work fine too, but this is what I like. Toasting the rice to a nice deep brown develops lots of flavor. Be careful & stir lots. I almost burned this one, but was able to save it by pulling it off the heat & stirring constantly. This was the last of my long grain rice. If I were less attentive I would have been starting over with short grain instead.

    - title: A bit of minced garlic for the Mexican rice and some sliced carrot, radish and garlic for a quick pickled vegetable garnish to go on top of the tostadas.

    - title: I pulsed half of a large can of whole peeled tomatoes & some water in the blender to make a puree and preheated it. The simmering tomato/water puree is dumped into the pot with the rice after it is toasted.

    - title: Chopped dried chipotle peppers dry toasted on the stove.  Toasting help builds flavor.  Then water is added to cover them and they are left to steep.

I love Mexican rice as a side with refried beans. I could eat them each by themselves and be happy, but I wanted to work them directly into a dish. With refried beans, tostadas came to mind first, so I started there and built onto it with what I had on hand. All homemade - fried flour tostadas topped with refried beans, Mexican rice, brussels sprouts slaw, avocado, pickled vegetables, and chipotle chili sauce.
