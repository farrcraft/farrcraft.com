Smash burger, per SE - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/03/ultra-smashed-cheeseburger-recipe-food-lab.html

5 ingredients - chuck steak, american cheese slice, hamburger bun, pickle, mayo.  Not counting - salt & pepper to season meat & butter to toast bun.

Chuck steak ground in food processor. 2 2oz balls formed & seasoned.

Toast the buns first.  The rest goes too quick to stop and take a picture.

Bonus - 3 Ingredient mac & cheese - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/01/3-ingredient-stovetop-mac-and-cheese-recipe.html

Decent mac & cheese, but there are better.  Pretty simple, though.  Came out with too much sauce with these particular noodles.
