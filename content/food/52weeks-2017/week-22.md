    - title: Time for another workout.  There is nothing about extracting paste from a tamarind brick that is not completely disgusting looking at every step.

Almost turned into a complete failure when one leg of my preheated Weber charcoal grill collapsed and the whole thing overturned in the yard. Managed to recover part of the coals & get to cooking.
