Chicken Satay & Dipping SauceAlmost turned into a complete failure when one leg of my preheated Weber charcoal grill collapsed and the whole thing overturned in the yard. Managed to recover part of the coals & get to cooking.

Lemongrass & friends about to get pulverized for the chicken marinade.

Getting a good workout.  This marinade also includes 2 whole tablespoons of fish sauce.  Boy is that stuff pungent.  I've ruined dishes with it before so I was worried. Fortunately it wasn't overwhelming with all of the other flavors going on in the end.

Ready for the grill.

Time for another workout.  There is nothing about extracting paste from a tamarind brick that is not completely disgusting looking at every step.
