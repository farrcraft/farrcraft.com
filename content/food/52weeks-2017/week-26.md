Blueberry BBQ Sauce - http://www.vindulge.com/2017/06/grilled-chicken-blackberry-bbq-sauce-recipe-video-northwest/

One chicken, 8:3:1:1 dry rub (http://www.the-greatest-barbecue-recipes.com/dry-rub-recipes.html) and 6 hours later.

Fire up the chimney starter.

Baste the sauce onto the chicken near the end.

Charcoal grills are unruly. Got a bit too charred in some spots.
