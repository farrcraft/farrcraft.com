Garlic Knots, whole roasted garlic, and marinara dipping sauce.
Bread recipe from - http://bakerbynature.com/homemade-garlic-knots/

Garlic Knot dough kneaded & ready for the first rest.

30 minutes later after the first rest.

Little knotted bread poops tucked in for their final proofing before getting a quick baste with the garlic sauce and going in the oven to bake.

Pile of minced raw garlic for the garlic sauce.

Out of the oven & basted with the rest of the garlic sauce.  A touch too browned in a few spots, but otherwise perfect.

Slice the top off a whole head of garlic, pour some olive oil over it, wrap it in foil and toss it in the oven.

Roasted head of garlic.  In the oven for 20 minutes along with the bread and then another 20 lowered to 400F.  This was a tiny head and it was a little too long & hot in the oven.  It was a little over roasted in spots.  Otherwise, it was very mild & sweet.
