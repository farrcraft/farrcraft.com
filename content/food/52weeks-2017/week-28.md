Straight out of the oven.   Maybe could have let them bake a few more minutes, but I was impatient.  These are messy and delicious (they're practically pure sugar, how could they not be?)  The "goo" turns into caramel.  Ran out of brown sugar, so substituted turbinado instead and used only unsalted butter.Recipe - https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/vanilla-bean-blueberry-lemon-cream-cheese-swirl-sticky-buns/
