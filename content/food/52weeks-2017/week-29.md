This is the recipe I used as a guide: http://steamykitchen.com/22276-chinese-spring-rolls-with-chicken-recipe.html
I stuffed these with a mixture of ground chicken, and shredded carrot & broccoli. What I thought was a bag of regular pre-shredded cabbage & carrots from Trader Joes turned out to be broccoli slaw.  I also tossed in a bit of extra pre-shredded carrot.  I just pulsed boneless/skinless chicken thighs in the food processor to make the ground chicken.

A vegetarian version omitting the chicken.  Served with Sriracha.

The non-vegetarian version came out less roll-shaped.

The won ton wrappers are way smaller than I expected.  This is my first time ever using them.  My roll up skills are pretty poor.  A half dozen in and I'm already tired of assembling these tiny morsels.

On to the meat version.  We're making blobs more than rolls at this point.

Ready as they ever will be for the fryer.  For their size, they're a bit annoying to assemble.  But hey, fried food - so worth it, I guess.
