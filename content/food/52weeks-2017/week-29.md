    - title: The won ton wrappers are way smaller than I expected.  This is my first time ever using them.  My roll up skills are pretty poor.  A half dozen in and I'm already tired of assembling these tiny morsels.

    - title: On to the meat version.  We're making blobs more than rolls at this point.

    - title: Ready as they ever will be for the fryer.  For their size, they're a bit annoying to assemble.  But hey, fried food - so worth it, I guess.

This is the recipe I used as a guide: http://steamykitchen.com/22276-chinese-spring-rolls-with-chicken-recipe.html
I stuffed these with a mixture of ground chicken, and shredded carrot & broccoli. What I thought was a bag of regular pre-shredded cabbage & carrots from Trader Joes turned out to be broccoli slaw.  I also tossed in a bit of extra pre-shredded carrot.  I just pulsed boneless/skinless chicken thighs in the food processor to make the ground chicken.
