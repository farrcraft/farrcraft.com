I go with the single tortilla, fold in the pan quesadilla technique.  Here we have shredded monterey jack, black beans, habanero hot sauce, and smoked chicken for our fillings.

The midnight quesadilla is best paired with funyuns.

Out of the skillet and chopped into flavor-enhancing triangles.

If you get those little cans of chipotle peppers in adobo and have leftover, you can toss it in a freezer bag.  Flatten it out and freeze it.  It'll come in handy when your midnight quesadilla needs some emergency chipotle sour cream for dipping.  If there's any lime on hand, add a splash of that too.
