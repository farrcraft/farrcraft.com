The BPT, or the Breaded Pork Tenderloin sandwich.  Simple, yet delicious.  Slice a pork tenderloin on a steep bias into 3 or 4 pieces. Pound each chunk into a large uniformly thin piece, around 1/4" thick.  Traditional 3 step breading station - flour, cayenne, salt & pepper followed by egg and finished with panko bread crumbs.  Shallow fry for 2-3 minutes per side.  Serve on a basic bun - I chose a pub-style bun, which is almost too fancy - simpler really is better for this one.  Dress with mustard & mayo.  Garnish with lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickle.  The fried tenderloin should ideally be at least 2-3 times the size of the bun.
