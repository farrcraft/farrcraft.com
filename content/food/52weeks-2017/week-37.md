    - title: Chili prep. I didn't feel like following a recipe, but here's the gist of it. I made two small pots, one vegetarian.  Substituting a little bit of bulgur for ground beef adds a bit of missing texture.  Diced onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, red kidney beans, black beans, chipotles in adobo, soy sauce, and a spice blend of chili powder, cayenne, coriander, cumin.  Don't forget salt and a splash of vinegar.  I also sprinkle in a spoonful of masa to thicken it up.

Standard Chili Dog topped with shredded monterey, onion, pickled wax peppers, and a dollop of sour cream on the side.
