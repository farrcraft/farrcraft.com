Bibimbap. Nothing much to it. Cook some rice. Julienne and saute some carrot and zucchini with garlic and ginger. Cook some spinach.  Soak some cucumber slices in a salt water brine.  Make some bibimbap sauce. Fry an egg.  I used the sauce proportions from this recipe - http://www.koreanbapsang.com/2015/01/bibimbap.html
