Bibimbap. Nothing much to it. Cook some rice. Julienne and saute some carrot and zucchini with garlic and ginger. Cook some spinach.  Soak some cucumber slices in a salt water brine.  Make some bibimbap sauce. Fry an egg.  I used the sauce proportions from this recipe - http://www.koreanbapsang.com/2015/01/bibimbap.html


Dak is apparently the chicken version of bulgogi.  Served with bibimbap. Recipe - http://www.koreanbapsang.com/2012/03/dak-bulgogi-korean-bbq-chicken.html


Almost forgot the fried egg.
