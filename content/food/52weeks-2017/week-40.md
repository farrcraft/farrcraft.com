German potato salad and beer braised sausage with peppers and onions.  It isn't much to look at, but it sure tastes good.  It really is quite surprisingly delicious for how simple it is to put together.

I deviated a bit on the sausage recipe, skipping pickling the bell peppers and onions.  I already had a batch of pickled banana pepper rings in the fridge and didn't want to wait to pickle the peppers and onions.  I used most of a bottle of Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest for the braising liquid - more than called for.  Even extending the cooking time a bit, I think the extra liquid kept the sausages from browning up as much.
