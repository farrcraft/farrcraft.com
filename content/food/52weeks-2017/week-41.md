This is the same process as Spanish-style blistered Padron peppers, but with pepperoncini peppers instead.  It's dead simple.  Just get a cast iron pan with a bit of oil smoking hot and cook the peppers just a minute or two until they blister.  Toss with some good olive oil and sprinkle with salt.  Done.

Fresh pepperoncini peppers.  I had two of these plants in my garden this year and they were very prolific producers.  One had the typical green peppers, but the other produced only red peppers.

More of that Portland hipster salt. It's actually made on the Oregon coast in Tillamook county.
