    - title: Bonus Casserole! Mushroom & sausage pasta bake.  This is a bit fussy for a casserole, but it's really good.  Recipe - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/cast-iron-cooking-crispy-baked-pasta-mushrooms-sausage-parmesan-cream-sauce-recipe.html I made this one vegetarian by swapping the stock and sausage.  It just needs the addition of some oil for frying the mushrooms.

Splat.  The lasagna roll up. Instead of layers, lay the noodle out, put filling on it, roll the noodle up.
Recipe based on - https://www.cookingclassy.com/spinach-four-cheese-lasagna-roll-ups/
The only cheese I had was a block of mozzarella. So I just shredded that up and used it.  I had the no boil kind of noodles.  I just soaked them in hot water until they were workable.
