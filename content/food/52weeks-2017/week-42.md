Splat.  The lasagna roll up. Instead of layers, lay the noodle out, put filling on it, roll the noodle up.
Recipe based on - https://www.cookingclassy.com/spinach-four-cheese-lasagna-roll-ups/
The only cheese I had was a block of mozzarella. So I just shredded that up and used it.  I had the no boil kind of noodles.  I just soaked them in hot water until they were workable.

Finish under the broiler for a minute or two.


Bonus Casserole! Mushroom & sausage pasta bake.  This is a bit fussy for a casserole, but it's really good.  Recipe - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/cast-iron-cooking-crispy-baked-pasta-mushrooms-sausage-parmesan-cream-sauce-recipe.html
I made this one vegetarian by swapping the stock and sausage.  It just needs the addition of some oil for frying the mushrooms.

You'd better like mushrooms.

I need a bigger pan.

Ready for topping.

Finally, it's a casserole.

The broiler is a fickle beast.
