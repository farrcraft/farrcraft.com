Pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sauce, fried sage, and toasted pecans.  This could have been a lot better, but I think I overworked the dough and probably burned the butter.


Pie pumpkins cut in half, seeds removed, and roasted in the oven @ 400F for 45 minutes.  Peel & puree in a food processor.  Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and maple syrup.  Mix in some ricotta too.


I used a pumpkin shaped cookie cutter to cut out the raviolis.
