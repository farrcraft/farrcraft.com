    - title: This batch was no less tasty than the one before it.  Only complaint is they were a little chewy.  The tortillas probably should have been lightly fried first.  I also usually use less sauce, leaving more tortilla exposed to get a bit of the edges crisped up.

(Un)Finished plate first. Your standard enchiladas combination platter.

I've made the rice and beans several times before and they're just the way I like them. This was my first time with this particular enchilada recipe.  I really liked it overall, but would make some small tweaks next time.

The base sauce is pretty similar to how I usually do it, though i don't typically add the roux and tend to keep it vegetarian without adding the beef.  This one has a great beefy flavor.  The onion didn't work for me so well on this one.  The dish only gets 15 minutes in the oven.  With both raw onion on top and as part of the filling, it's just too overpowering.  Next time I might cut down on the amount of onion used for filling - or saute it up with some extra ground beef for a meatier filling.  

I also only had a 10 pack of tortillas while the recipe wanted an even dozen.  Even so, that seemed plenty to fill my 2L baking dish and I still ended up with more sauce than would fit.  More tortillas and a larger dish would have been better.

Bonus Round!

The reason I only used half of the 3 bags of chiles was so that I could use the other half to make a batch of vegetarian sauce.  The Mexican rice recipe also produces more tomato puree than the recipe actually calls for, so the extra goes into this sauce. No beef and substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock, minus the volume of the tomato puree.
