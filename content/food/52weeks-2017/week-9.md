Chickpea Masala. Garnished with cilantro & served with naan.
I started with this Serious Eats recipe - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/01/quick-easy-pressure-cooker-chicken-and-chickpea-masala.html as a basic template and just riffed a simple vegetarian version based on what I had on hand.  Even this screwed up rendition was really good.  I'm sure the original recipe is even better.

I'm starting with these dried chickpeas. Soak a cup of beans covered in water overnight. They soak up a lot of liquid so it ends up being more like two cups in the end.

Green bell pepper, jalapeno, minced garlic, grated ginger, diced onion, chopped tomato, chopped cilantro, drained chickpeas. Spice mix - garam masala (leftover from last week), turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, scotch bonnet chili powder, black pepper, and salt.  Unpictured, tomato paste & vegetable oil.

Start pressure cooker on saute mode with oil, onions, garlic, and ginger to brown them first. Knock the peppers and cilantro off the edge of the counter onto the floor (this is a very wasteful recipe). Add spices & tomato paste followed by tomatoes, chickpeas, & a cup of water. Seal up and pressure cook on high for 20 minutes. Release pressure, stir in lemon juice & reduce back on saute mode. Turn off heat & stir in heavy cream.
