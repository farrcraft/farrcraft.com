    - title: It's all about the onions.  Lots of onions.  Browning takes time and patience.  These have been going a while, but they're still not there.  They slowly break down and brown in all of that butter.

In hindsight, I wish I could find my mom's recipe.  This is this one - https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Browned-Onion-Kugels-231507
It's not the one I remember (every Jewish grandmother must have their own recipe), but it's a good basic version.  By cooking in a muffin tray, you get more of the brown crusty bits in an easy to serve format.  The onions already bring a lot of sweetness to it, but you could easily tweak it more toward the savory or sweet side with minor adjustments or additions.
