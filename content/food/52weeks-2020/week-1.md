In hindsight, I wish I could find my mom's recipe.  This is this one - https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Browned-Onion-Kugels-231507
It's not the one I remember (every Jewish grandmother must have their own recipe), but it's a good basic version.  By cooking in a muffin tray, you get more of the brown crusty bits in an easy to serve format.  The onions already bring a lot of sweetness to it, but you could easily tweak it more toward the savory or sweet side with minor adjustments or additions.

It's all about the onions.  Lots of onions.  Browning takes time and patience.  These have been going a while, but they're still not there.  They slowly break down and brown in all of that butter.

It goes in looking pretty unappealing.

Brown and crispy edges out of the oven.
