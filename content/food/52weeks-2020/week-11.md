This recipe is from the BraveTart book (Stella Parks from Serious Eats).  It's one of the easier ones to assemble.  Pineapple, brown sugar (& dark rum) topping, and cake batter layered in a cast iron pan.

Stella's example uses cute little star shaped pineapple cut outs.  It's dangerous business going out these days, so I works with what I gots. All we had was a drawer full of Halloween themed cookie cutters.  I'm calling it "Kawaii Goth".  That's a thing, right?

Inventory at the supermarket has become pretty sparse in a lot of areas, but by some fortune there hadn't been a complete run on pineapples and coconut milk.

Layered into a cast iron pan and into the oven for 55(!) minutes to bake.

Derp.
