    - title: I still had some leftover ingredients from last week's enchiladas and no sense wasting frying oil if I already have it out.  So why not chimichangas too?  Filled with shredded chicken, mexican rice, and cheddar cheese.  Topped with more red sauce, avocado lime sour cream, and cotija cheese.

Hush Puppies 

I didn't have my frying oil temperature dialed in.  Some got a bit darker than ideal.  And some of them were a bit more mishapen than others.  Still taste the same though.

- 1c cornmeal
- 1/2c flour
- 1tbsp sugar
- 2tsp baking powder
- 1/4tsp cayenne
- 1tsp salt
- grated onion
- 1/2 milk
- 1tsp hot sauce
- 1/4tsp garlic powder
