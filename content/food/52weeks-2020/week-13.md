Hush Puppies 

I didn't have my frying oil temperature dialed in.  Some got a bit darker than ideal.  And some of them were a bit more mishapen than others.  Still taste the same though.

1c cornmeal
1/2c flour
1tbsp sugar
2tsp baking powder
1/4tsp cayenne
1tsp salt
grated onion
1/2 milk
1tsp hot sauce
1/4tsp garlic powder


I still had some leftover ingredients from last week's enchiladas and no sense wasting frying oil if I already have it out.  So why not chimichangas too?

Filled with shredded chicken, mexican rice, and cheddar cheese.  Topped with more red sauce, avocado lime sour cream, and cotija cheese.
