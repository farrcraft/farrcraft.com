What's red & white all over?  A bean week double feature, of course.   First up, a gratin made of white beans, kale, and shaved fennel root.  The recipe comes from: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/swiss-chard-fennel-white-bean-gratin-recipe.html

The main event.  Chili mac courtesy of another Kenji recipe - https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/01/cheesy-chili-mac-recipe.html This is a vegetarian version, omitting ground beef and adding corn & brocolli.  Because we have them and why not.
