Chicken, chickpea, and potato curry served in a hollowed out bread pocket.

Curry recipe from - https://www.africanbites.com/bunny-chow/

For a thicker curry, stir in a cornstarch slurry (start with 1tsp) near the end.  To keep it vegan, kick out the chicken and substitute more vegetables - carrots, bell peppers, peas, whatever.

Downscaled to half volume recipe to make 3 small loaves.
