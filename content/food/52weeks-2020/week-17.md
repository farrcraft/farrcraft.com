Homemade noodles and a slow simmered sugo with pork sausage meatballs made from home ground pork shoulder.  I just used the dough recipe right in the pasta roller manual.  Every food blog has about the same recipe.  It's just flour, eggs, salt and water.  I don't have an exact recipe for the sugo, it's more of a template.  Measurements are generally just a guess.

4oz pancetta, finely diced (1 Trader Joe's package or some equivalent amount)
olive oil
unsalted butter

mirepoix
1 yellow onion, finely diced
3 celery ribs, finely diced
2 carrots, finely diced

herb boquette
1 bay leaf
3 sprigs thyme
1 sprig rosemary
2 sage leaves

2tbsp tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, minced

28oz can whole peeled tomatoes, pureed with a stick blender in the can
1c dry white wine
1c chicken stock

2# spicy Italian pork sausage meatballs

salt throughout to taste

mirepoix - 2:1:1 ratio of onion, celery, carrot - however many celery ribs and carrots that ends up being depending on the onion.

Process

Preheat oven 325F.
Starting with a cold dutch oven, render fat from pancetta.
Reserve pancetta, leaving rendered fat.
Add 1tbsp oil & 1tbsp butter.
After butter is melted and stops foaming, add mirepoix.
Add salt.
Sweat vegetables until transparent, softened.
Add tomato paste, garlic, herb boquette.
Brown tomato paste.
Add white wine.
Heat on med-high/high to reduce wine.
Add stock, tomatoes, meatballs, pancetta.
Heat to simmer.
Transfer to oven, partially covered.
Cook at least 2 hours, give it a stir about every 45 minutes, scraping down the sides and rearranging meatballs.


Stand mixer pasta roller attachments are the noodle making cheat code.  There's also a meat grinder attachment for making the sausage.


Flattened dough sheets ready to be cut into noodles.  Also, chocolate muffins for later.

Fettuccine tree.  The noodles just need a couple minutes in a pot of boiling salted water and they'll be good to go.
