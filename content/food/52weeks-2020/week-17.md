Homemade noodles and a slow simmered sugo with pork sausage meatballs made from home ground pork shoulder.  I just used the dough recipe right in the pasta roller manual.  Every food blog has about the same recipe.  It's just flour, eggs, salt and water.  I don't have an exact recipe for the sugo, it's more of a template.  Measurements are generally just a guess.

- 4oz pancetta, finely diced (1 Trader Joe's package or some equivalent amount)
- olive oil
- unsalted butter

#### mirepoix
- 1 yellow onion, finely diced
- 3 celery ribs, finely diced
- 2 carrots, finely diced

#### herb boquette
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 sprigs thyme
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 2 sage leaves

- 2tbsp tomato paste
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

- 28oz can whole peeled tomatoes, pureed with a stick blender in the can
- 1c dry white wine
- 1c chicken stock

- 2# spicy Italian pork sausage meatballs

- salt throughout to taste

mirepoix - 2:1:1 ratio of onion, celery, carrot - however many celery ribs and carrots that ends up being depending on the onion.

#### Process

1. Preheat oven 325F.
2. Starting with a cold dutch oven, render fat from pancetta.
3. Reserve pancetta, leaving rendered fat.
4. Add 1tbsp oil & 1tbsp butter.
5. After butter is melted and stops foaming, add mirepoix.
