Terrible pictures this week.  Not that any of the rest have been winners.
It's just a basic ginger beef & vegetable stir fry served over brown rice. No real recipe I followed, but I recommend this for guidelines - https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/b0zql0/basic_techniques_how_to_make_any_chinese_stir_fry/

It's a crime scene.  Since I'm freestyling here, I ended up sauce heavy.

Bonus round. Miso ginger dressing.
