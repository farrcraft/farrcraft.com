Red lentils (dhal) & Coconut Curry
Garnished with cilantro and a splash of lime and served with a piece of warm naan.

This is super simple and crazy delicious. Plus it's vegan.  A couple points of reference:

There are some things that I don't have readily on hand like curry leaves or saffron powder.  I order things a bit differently too - toast whole spices in oil, add & sautee aromatics (onion, chile, garlic), bloom ground spices, add rinsed uncooked lentils & stock/water, heat to boil & simmer until lentils cooked, adding more stock/water as necessary & stirring to keep from sticking & burning in the bottom of the pot.  Stir in the coconut milk near the end.
