Having never cooked with miso and not really knowing anything about it, this is the one I picked at the store.

This is primarily the recipe I followed - https://umamigirl.com/easy-vegetarian-ramen/ 

I haven't come across a lot of vegetarian ramen broths and I'm not extremely versed in what qualifies as good/bad/authentic ramen.   Despite some minor execution miscalculations, I thought this was really quite tasty, though.  Blending the rehydrated mushrooms with the stock makes for a rich and creamy broth - I don't even think it necessarily needs the extra pat of butter at the end.  Also, rather than mincing the garlic and ginger, I just cut them in half and got a nice char on them along with the sliced onion when making the base for the broth.

In this bowl - noodles, broth, baby spinach, bamboo shoots, corn, sauteed shiitakes, baked tofu, soft boiled egg.

Even though I've cooked plenty of hard boiled eggs before, I'm not big on soft-boiled eggs and clearly have no practice making those, so the result ain't pretty.  The tofu here was also over-baked - I probably should have done a different preparation or just baked it a little less.

Not pictured, I also had some sliced miso glazed pork tenderloin.  Which, while it probably didn't fit the ramen, was good on its own.  I started with a plain sous vide, as per - https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-hoisin-glazed-pork-tenderloin 
Except using this glaze instead: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roast-pork-tenderloin-with-apricot-miso-glaze
Additionally, I just used the oven broiler for a quick minute or two per side - applying the glaze and rotating instead of bothering with the grill.

Since I've got the miso to use, why not throw together some simple glazed carrots (and a random leftover parsnip) while I'm at it.  Recipe from - https://omnivorescookbook.com/glazed-carrots/

I found these fresh noodles at one of the local Asian markets.  They had a bazillion different kinds of noodles to choose from.  These were found in the refrigerated section and actually say Ramen on them.  So I assume they must be the right ones.

I couldn't find anything that actually said "Kombu" on it at the previously said Asian market.  If I don't know anything about miso, I know even less about seaweed.  Anyway, I tossed a few inch piece off this sheet into the broth base.
