Hummus.  Lots of it.
It's another Kenji recipe - https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/israeli-style-extra-smooth-hummus-recipe.html

Garbanzos. A 1/2" of dried beans doesn't seem like much, but it somehow turns into over a quart of hummus.  That's how we're measuring hummus now - in quarts.

Bonus Round.  Might as well make some falafel while we're on the garbanzo train.  Once again, courtesy Kenji - https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/the-food-lab-vegan-experience-best-homemade-falafel-recipe.html
