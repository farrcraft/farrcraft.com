Recipe from - https://www.billyparisi.com/the-best-authentic-new-orleans-beignets-recipe/

I thought these were going to be a fail.  The dough seemed way too sticky and I just kept adding more flour while the mixer continued to knead.  Also the oil I was frying in was pretty shallow.  Despite all of that, they're actually just ok.  Maybe a little chewier and unevenly cooked in some spots than ideal, but even a bad doughnut is still a doughnut.
