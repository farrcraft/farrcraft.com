Dried chickpeas soaked overnight, drained & dried, tossed in salt & olive oil and roasted on a sheet pan at 400F for 35 minutes.  Tossed with cayenne, paprika, and a squeeze of lime. 
Turns out these probably should have been roasted longer.  There were some good crunchy darker ones, but there were a good percentage that were under done.  Even simple seeming things like these are harder than they look sometimes.
