    - title: Start with fermented french fries - whole russet potatoes, cut into strips and soaked in a 4% brine for 3-4 days.  Inoculate it with a shot of yogurt whey or kimchi juice to kickstart things.  When they're done they'll have salt & vinegar sort of flavor to them.

    - title: After the first of two fries.  The first time at 325F for 5 minutes and then a second time at 375F for another 2 minutes.  I'm just using a pot of peanut oil on a gas stove and a thermapen.  It's not an exact science.
