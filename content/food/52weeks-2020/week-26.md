Recipe from https://www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/2012/07/02/super-soft-n-chewy-hoagie-rolls/
I should have done a better job dividing and shaping the rolls.  These ended up not having much rise in the end.  Still taste fine though.

Open face meatball hoagie - Bread, meatballs, marinara, parmesan, provolone, parsley.
