Now, you could follow a real recipe like this: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/simple-vinaigrette-recipe.html
But if I just want a quick single serving of salad dressing, this is how I do it. The most important part is the 3:1 ratio of vinegar & oil.  And it doesn't have to be an exact fussy measurement.  I start with vinegar, 2 parts neutral oil, 1 part olive oil.  The oil will float on top, so it's easy to eyeball the amount. Then a big dollop of mustard, splash of lemon juice, and a healthy pinch of salt & fresh ground pepper.  Seal up the mason jar and shake the hell out of it.  Et voila - salad dressing. 

This has just been my go-to ingredient set lately, but you can mix it up such as the aforementioned recipe.  Different vinegars (e . g. balsamic), mustard (or mayo instead for a creamier dressing), etc.

Hey ma, it's an emulsification!  This shake it all up in a jar method works great for one-off servings.  It's not necessarily super stable and may eventually separate if you leave it.  But just shake it up again.
