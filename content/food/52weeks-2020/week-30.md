The first of 3 burger experiences, two burgers each.  One 80/20 ground beef and the other ground Impossible.  These are all taken from the Bob's Burgers cookbook.

First up is the "Don't Get Creme Fraiche With Me Burger".
Patty mixed with mashed blueberries and breadcrumbs,
spring salad,
chopped basil & creme fraiche.


The "Chevre Which Way But Loose Burger".
Garlic infused patty,
Herbed (Sage, Oregano, Thyme, Rosemary) chevre/tomato/cucumber/mayonnaise spread,
sliced cucumber,
red onion.

And last but not least, the "Bleu Is The Warmest Cheese Burger".
Patty mixed with diced celery and wing sauce (butter, Frank's Red Hot, cayenne, white vinegar),
bleu cheese sauce (butter, milk, flour, diced onion, blue cheese),
lettuce & toasted bun.

Also, bonus french fries.
Peeled and cut russet potatoes, par-boiled 5 minutes in salted water, set out to cool and dry and then fried at 350F until brown and crispy.  Serve with extra wing sauce mayo & bleu cheese sauces for dipping.

Final verdict?  These are all fun novelty burgers.  None of them are bad, but they won't be the best burger you've ever had either.  Playful, but still delicious - a burger is still a burger.
