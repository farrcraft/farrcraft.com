A few different experiments this week.  First up, Cucumber Gazpacho: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cucumber-tomatillo-gazpacho
This is an interesting one.  At first it tasted really good, but after a few bites it got really hard to keep eating.  It has a very aggressive flavor profile that I don't think makes it work for a main dish.  It would be fine as a small starter portion or as sauce served alongside something else (like maybe pork tenderloin).

And now for a cucumber & cottage cheese salad: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/for-the-love-of-cottage-cheese-salad
This sounds kind of strange on paper, but if you like cottage cheese, this is a pretty good combination.

And finally, Falafel and cucumber salad - https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/falafel-fritters-bowl-with-cucumbers-and-yogurt-sauce

Admittedly, cucumbers are not the star here.  Next time around I'd probably work them into a tzatziki sauce also.
