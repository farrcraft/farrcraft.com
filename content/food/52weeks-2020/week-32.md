I'm not even going to bother with plating and presentation. These came out a hot mess.  Dough came out better than I've done in a while, but otherwise my baking skills continue to suck.  Regardless how they look, they do taste great.  Sugar, cinnamon, freshly ground green cardamom - why wouldn't they?
