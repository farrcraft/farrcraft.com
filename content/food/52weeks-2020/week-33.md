I tend to find vegan cooking to be very idiosyncratic or maybe even esoteric with a lot of recipe constructions compared to their non-vegan counterparts.  This pair is no exception with its huge amount of cornstarch, ground flax seeds, and vinegar curdled almond milk. 

Despite the deep frying, a lot of the excessive cornstarch coating on the chickpea fritters stayed as white flakes.  Flavor-wise, they're actually pretty good - crispy outside, but still light and fluffy on the inside - not too dense or too crunchy. 

 The waffles were a flop for me.  The flax introduces a lot of nuttiness to the flavor and the batter just didn't work like I expect a normal waffle batter to work.  So they ended up coming out a bit flat and with a texture and flavor that just didn't do it for me.
