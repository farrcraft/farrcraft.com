Italian Sausage & Mushroom Pie
- 24 hour cold ferment dough, 57% hydration
- Home ground sausage (seasoned 24 hours before grinding)
- Homemade fresh mozzarella (less than an hour)

Dough & FSWY sauce recipe from "The Elements of Pizza".  The book has dough hydration levels calibrated for a home oven (70%).  Since I cook my pies in an Ooni Pro, I adjusted the dough for the much hotter and faster cooking time.  The sausage recipe is the hot Italian seasoning mix from The Food Lab book.

I've made farmers cheeses before, but this was my first go at a real cheese using rennet.  It started to burn really quickly in the pizza oven unlike what I'd expect from a store-bought cheese.
