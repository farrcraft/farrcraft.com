From Daniel Gritzer's SE recipe - https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/arancini-rice-balls-recipe.html 

Not perfectly shaped, but I didn't fuss too much trying to get them formed.  The recipe says 12-15, but I think I ended up with 23.  I used sushi rice as recommended and cooked it in the pressure cooker.  The only deviation from the recipe was to keep them vegetarian, replacing chicken for vegetable stock and omitting the gelatin.  I didn't find the lack of gelatin to end up being a problem and there wasn't any need to substitute an alternative thickener.  Either way, make sure to use a really good stock.  I didn't have a vegetable stock that I really like and found that it had a strong flavor that carried through too much into the final product.

A core of melty mozzarella (homemade - leftover from last week's pizza project).

Laid out on a sheet pan to chill (one of two).  Skip the parchment paper and just use a silpat.  The yellow hue is probably due in part not just to the saffron (which I ended up not having very much of), but also the color of the vegetable stock.  I'd use a better quality stock next time.

Roughly formed and ready to fry.
