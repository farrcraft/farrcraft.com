Jerk Tofu & Chicken w/ Rice & Peas 

I started with the marinade from this recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/08/jerk-chicken.html
Chicken thighs and pressed extra firm tofu were marinated (separately) overnight in vacuum sealed bags.  The chicken was sous vide for 3 hours @ 165F and the tofu for 2 hours @ 180F.  They were both finished in a cast iron pan in the Ooni Pro for a few minutes.  I ended up not really liking the end result.  The marinade especially didn't seem well suited for the tofu.  It was way too salty for my taste.  I like the sous vide preparation, but using the pizza oven didn't seem to add much.  I'd have been as well off just using the oven broiler.

The rice & peas came from this recipe: https://healthiersteps.com/recipe/instant-pot-jamaican-rice-and-peas/
This one was a complete failure.  For some reason the rice came out with some crunchy parts to it.  The bottom of the instant pot was also scorched.
