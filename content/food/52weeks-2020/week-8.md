    - title: The source recipe wasn't designed for a 900F pizza oven.  So the already roasted sprouts got extra charred.  I also for some reason had a harder time stretching the dough on this one.  Outside of the charred bits, this was actually pretty good.

Let's combine two vegetables every kid hates with something every kid loves - pizza!  Asparagus pie goes first.

Shaved asparagus, shallots, white sauce, mozzarella, grated parmesan, garlic herb crust.  This is one of two - the second also had crumbled bacon.  The white sauce recipe comes from https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/white-pizza-sauce .

Next, we have brussel sprouts, homemade chorizo, shallots, white sauce, mozzarella, grated parmesan. Some obvious execution errors here.  Based on this recipe:
