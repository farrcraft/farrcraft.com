Flank steak with chimichurri.
The chimichurri is cilantro, parsley, shallot, garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and olive oil.  No measurements, just toss a bunch of stuff in a food processor and chop it up.  Save adding the olive oil until the end.

Makeshift hibatchi grill por uno.  Flip a chimney starter upside down loaded with charcoal on the shallow end.  Put it all on top of a pie tin to catch the ash.  Apply blowtorch to light and top with a grill.
