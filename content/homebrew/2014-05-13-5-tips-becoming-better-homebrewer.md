  Being a good homebrewer can mean a lot of different things. Maybe you want to consistently brew the best doppelbock on the planet. Or it could mean conjuring up a wild new recipe and having it turn out perfect every time. Whatever way you define it, there are a number of ways that you can improve your craft. These are just a few ideas that can help you on your way.

## 1. Join a club

There are many advantages to joining a homebrew club. First, clubs provide a great venue for interacting with other brewers. Being able to &#8220;talk shop&#8221; with fellow brewers can make a big impact on your brewing. You can trade tips and learn from those more experienced than yourself. Most clubs also typically have meetings or other events where you can share your homebrews. This is a great way to get honest feedback on your beer and use it to improve the next batch. Other benefits to becoming a club member can range from brewing classes or other educational events offered through the club, group brew days, and even discounts on brewing supplies through either LHBS discounts or group buys.

## 2. Enter competitions

Entering your beer into competitions is another great way to improve your homebrew. Competitions can range from informal club gatherings to much more structured events with experienced ranked BJCP judges evaluating and scoring your beer. The score sheets garnered from these events can provide a useful tool for identifying the flaws in your beer. The best score sheet feedback will not only point out the defects, but offer suggestions on potential changes to your recipe or brewing techniques to fix these problems. The Homebrewer&#8217;s Association maintains a calendar of [sanctioned competitions][1] you can schedule to enter into. Your local homebrew supply shop is also a good place to inquire about competitions. 

## 3. Train your palate

How do you know that you&#8217;re making good beer if you don&#8217;t know what good beer tastes like? Maybe you&#8217;ve flipped through the style guidelines and decided to brew a Roggenbier. You probably want to taste a few examples in order to compare how well your own is in relation to the style. Seeking out commercial examples that highlight certain ingredients or styles can be an invaluable tool for training your senses.

On the other side of the coin &#8211; how can you identify good beer if you can&#8217;t spot bad beer? Being able to pick out undesirable flavors and understand their causes is no less important. There are several kits available for purchase which can be used to dose samples of otherwise good beer with known off flavors. These various additives each alter the flavor of a neutral beer sample in order to highlight specific off flavors. Maybe you&#8217;re not sure how to detect DMS or diacetyl flaws in a beer. These kits can be a good way to learn how to identify these specific flavor profiles.

## 4. Join the AHA

The AHA is a national organization which promotes homebrewing. By joining the AHA you gain access to a wealth of homebrewing resources. Membership includes a subscription to the bimonthly Zymurgy publication as well as online access to past issues, community forums, and other online content for expanding your homebrewing knowledge. There are also an increasing number of member deals including discounts at various brew pubs and brewing supply stores that make membership worthwhile.

## 5. Practice / Document

It&#8217;s also important to keep good records of your brewing process. Becoming a better brewer is not just a matter of brewing better beer, but also about doing it consistently. One of the best ways to get consistent batches is through thorough documentation of your processes. When something about the current batch turns out different from the previous ones, you should have detailed notes to reference and help diagnose what caused those differences.

The bottom line is that mastery of any skill set takes lots of practice and time committed to improving those skills. In theory, the more you brew, the better at it you&#8217;ll become. So with that in mind, keep on brewing and perfecting your craft with every batch.
