  If you pay much attention to the craft section of the beer aisle, you&#8217;ve probably come across a lot of different beers that add up to more than just three key ingredients. On the shelves are everything ranging from stouts with chocolate and chili peppers, saisons with all kinds of fruits and spices, to style-defying brews made with every kind of adjunct or additive imaginable. For a time, this wasn&#8217;t always the case.

It was the tail end of the Middle Ages when the Reinheitsgebot was enacted. Commonly referred to as the German beer purity law, this regulation restricted beer brewing to only three ingredients &#8211; barley, water, and hops. The most notable omission in this list is, of course, yeast. However, it would be another four centuries before Louis Pasteur identified yeast&#8217;s involvement in the fermentation process. A primary goal of this regulation was price control for bread. By restricting the usage of grains such as wheat and rye, they would remain both plentiful and affordable for bakers.

Another key point was the restriction to using hops. Hops haven&#8217;t always been the preferred additive for making beer bitter. Before beer and hops were synonymous, herb mixtures known as gruits were a quite common substitute for providing bitterness and flavoring. Today the additions can include a wide range of ingredients such as mugwort, rosemary, tarot, juniper berries, bog myrtle, sweet gale and more. In those days of unregulated brewing the list also included things like soot, psychoactive mushrooms, and other questionable ingredients. Limiting what went into the beer also became a health safety and quality control measure.

Only in the last few decades has the notion of beer quality through ingredient restrictions been reduced to nothing more than a marketing pitch. Today, the Reinheitsgebot is all but entirely eliminated in practice. Even though at the time the laws forced many local beer styles to become extinct, some have still managed to survive. Most notably are the German and Bavarian wheat beer styles Hefeweizen or Weissebier. 

Innovative craft brewers continue to experiment and push the boundaries of what can go into beer. Sure, the results might not always please our palates, but sometimes they offer up wonderful and amazing experiences. They give us pause to question the role of style and how we define beer. So, the next time you&#8217;re planning a new beer recipe, don&#8217;t forget to consider the kitchen pantry.
