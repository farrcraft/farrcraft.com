This is a portion of my old propane-fired homebrewing setup for 5 gallon batches.


## The Gear (above)

10 gallon cooler MLT
30 plate Duda Diesel plate chiller
7 gallon BK
Propane burner


## BK

![BK](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/2-bk.jpg)

Bayou Classic kettle w/ lid & burner w/ high pressure regulator.
Kettle is fitted with ball valves for transferring & recirculating plus a sight glass & thermometer.


## Lower Kettle

![Lower Kettle](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/3-lower-kettle.jpg)

All fittings are weldless.  The valves are fitted with quick connect fittings.


## Upper Kettle

The sight glass is plastic, a kit from Bargain Fittings.  There is still some tape residue on the tube from where I had calibrated half gallon volume markers.


## Kettle Interior

The thermometer pokes into the kettle slightly.
There is a fine mesh 12" stainless steel filter tube on the bottom valve.


## Lower MLT

![Lower MLT](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/6-lower-mlt.jpg)

The MLT is fitted with a weldless bulkhead and thermometer.  This just needs a ball valve added.


## MLT Interior

![MLT Interior](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/7-mlt-interior.jpg)

The thermometer extends inside a fair amount.
I made a filter from the braided metal sheathing of a water flex line.  It's seen better days and it was never really great, but I did make a lot of good beer with it.  I'd probably consider replacing it with a false bottom or something better.


## Chiller Side

![Chiller Side](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/8-chiller-side.jpg)

30 plate HEX wort chiller with all identical barbed hose fittings.


## Chiller Label

![Chiller Label](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/9-chiller-label.jpg)

Technical specs.


## Hose Assortment

![Hose Assortment](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/10-hose-assortment.jpg)

A bunch of pieces of hosing for making various connections between components.  A few have quick connect fittings and hose clamps.  A few are missing hose clamps and need reassembled.  The hoses have seen many gallons and could be replaced, but should still function just fine for hot-side tasks.


## Assorted Parts

![Assorted Parts](/homebrew/images/backyard-brewery-v2/11-assorted-parts.jpg)

A couple extra quick connect fittings for e.g., a Chugger pump, a garden hose quick connect fitting, o-rings and extra fender washer for weldless connections, brass pipe nipples, a stainless hose barb fitting, and a weldless eye bolt set from the sight glass kit.
