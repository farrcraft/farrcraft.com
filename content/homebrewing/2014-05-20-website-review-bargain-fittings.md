  For some, brewing isn&#8217;t just about the beer or even the process. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to tinker and build. For those brewers, taking a stock stainless stock pot or camping cooler and tricking it out with all of the bells and whistles to turn it into an awesome piece of brewing equipment is an equally important part of the hobby. There is also the group that might just want one or two small upgrades to their equipment, but doesn&#8217;t possess a full workshop of tools or a mechanical engineering degree to implement anything too complex.

This is where a site like <a href="http://www.bargainfittings.com/" target="_blank">Bargain Fittings</a> comes in. There, you&#8217;ll find everything from valves, sightglasses, weldless bulkhead fittings, disconnects, thermometers, and tubing to tie it all together. Their kits will satisfy those looking for little projects without a bunch of complicated parts matching. The more advanced tinkerers will still find plenty of individual pieces and one-offs for their franken-creations.

If you&#8217;ve spent any time at all shopping online, you&#8217;ve probably come across at least one or two fancy websites packed with slick visuals and highly interactive experiences. Maybe it&#8217;s got a little bit of that, but it remains anything but pretentious. Many of the items you might be able to find elsewhere. The benefit here is that the individual parts have already been pulled together and everything listed is meant specifically for use in brewing.

Sure, you could comb through the thousands of products of the McMaster-Carr catalog or wander the aisles of your neighborhood big box hardware store. You&#8217;ll often come away with a pack of washers when you only needed one or a vexing puzzle of components that are almost, but not quite right. Maybe that 1/2&#8243; lock nut is only available in brass when everything else is stainless steel or the only possible configuration that might work from the parts on the shelves means having to use that one extra coupling you&#8217;d really prefer to omit if only that nipple were an available in an extra inch.

Your trusty brewmaster has personally bought a number of items including [thermometers][1] for boil kettles and mash tuns, a [sight gauge][2] (including a port for mounting one of the aforementioned thermometers), cooler bulkhead kits and miscellaneous other parts.
