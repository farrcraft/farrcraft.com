Before I had even completely solidified my design, I had already started ordering the parts from the different vendors.  Since I was still following a lot of the original Electric Brewery design, many of the parts lists remained unchanged.  I planned to spend a few months slowly stocking up the parts before I actually started building.  This would both give me time to finalize some of my design modifications and spread out some of the initial costs.

## Element Construction


I kicked off the assembly process with the element housing boxes.  These are just weatherproof 2-gang outlet boxes with a few modifications made to them.  I picked the boxes up from Home Depot.  The construction is pretty easy.  I just used a hole saw and drilled a hole in the back of the boxes for the elements to fit through.


The boxes don&#8217;t have a perfectly smooth back that would let them sit flush against the outside of the kettles.  To counter this, a second blank face plate is glued to the back of the box.  I used a dremel to knock down any protrusions on the back of the box so the plate would sit flush in place and then secured it with J-B Weld.


The boxes I bought each had 4 knockout holes in them, but I only needed one of them.  However, the boxes only came with 2 plastic hole plugs.  I was able to find additional metal plugs online.  After priming and painting the boxes, they were ready to install in the kettles.

Installation is pretty straightforward, too.  It just takes the stomach to cut some extra holes in your brand new shiny $400 Blichmann kettles.  With a decent step bit and the correctly sized Greenlee punch, it&#8217;s a snap otherwise.  I only made one minor mistake and placed the hole on the wrong side of the boil kettle.


Fortunately, the exact placement isn&#8217;t too important.  I had only preferred one side to the other for my particular brewery layout.  Taking into account the cord routing from the element back to the control panel could be an important deciding factor.  Functionally, it would work just as well mounted on the back as it would on either side.


The other placement consideration is the height of the element in the kettle.  I wanted to still have the option of brewing 5 gallon batches if I wanted, so I needed to make sure the element wasn&#8217;t too high up in the kettle.  It does need to be place high enough that there is room for the box on the outside.


The weldless fittings &#8211; combined with some additional food-grade silicone around the element base inside the housing box for additional assurance that water and electricity will never meet &#8211; are simple and secure.  Once the cords get wired in, it&#8217;s time to move on to the next phase of the project.

## A Brief Failure

The HERMS coil &#8211; a core component of the system &#8211; presented its own set of challenges.  As with the rest, initially I wanted to build my own coil.  This meant taking an existing coil and recoiling it down to a diameter that fit inside one of the kettles.  From reading extensive forum threads from others going down the same road, I knew it was going to be a difficult endeavor.


I started off with 50 feet of 1/2&#8243; diameter 304 stainless steel tubing with a .02 inch wall thickness.  The preferred 316 stainless with 0.28 inch wall thickness was also available for twice the price.  I went with the cheaper option, but I doubt it would have made any difference.  I started securing sections of the tubing with zip ties followed by even more zip ties.  Using one of my older smaller kettles as a form, I worked to slowly coil the tubing down.  I added some twine to the zip ties to help hold the tubing in place.


The zip ties I started with weren&#8217;t strong enough. After a few of them snapped under the strain, I bought some heavier ones and tried those.  Even then it remained difficult and delicate work to continue coiling the tubing down without kinking it in the process.


A number of forum users recommended finding either commercial shops equipped with professional tubing benders or custom built jigs to assist with the task.  After struggling over the better part of a week and introducing a few more kinks along the way, I finally admitted defeat.  I gave up on trying to form the coil myself and just ordered a pre-made one.


## Kettle Assembly

As I waited for the HERMS coil to arrive, I went ahead and finished the rest of the kettle plumbing.
