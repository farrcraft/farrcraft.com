# I. It's About The Process

> Or, in another way of saying - it's about the journey and not the destination.


Some projects have a very definitive and clear trajectory of beginning, middle and end with a well-defined end state of being.  There are others that you will find you revisit over time and never seem to be done with.  Sometimes a project is just a single step in a much larger process of evolution.

When it comes to your workspace or its infrastructure, don't consider it as a project you could just cross off your list and be done with forever.  As your needs as a maker change, your space should always be free to evolve and change to meet them.
