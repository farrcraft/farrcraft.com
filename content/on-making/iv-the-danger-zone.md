# IV. Clear The Danger Zone

Any time that you are working any material with a tool, consider the path that tool takes as it interacts with the work.  Where does that path lead beyond material?  If you're cutting a piece of material with a knife, which direction is that knife moving as it is doing its work?  Are you drawing the knife through the work toward yourself or are you pushing the knife away as you're working?  Where will it be directed in case you, the tool, or the material slips in some direction?  Will you be in the path of the tool?  Think through your motions and actions beforehand and gain an understanding of how your actions can go wrong.  Try and stay clear of those danger zones.  Consider the failure modes of your tools and materials.  If you're working at the table saw, understand how kickbacks happen and stand to the side outside of the traditional kickback path.  Never disable or remove safety mechanisms.  Always use appropriate work holding.  If a jig or fixture will provide a safer and more reliable operation, take that extra setup time.
