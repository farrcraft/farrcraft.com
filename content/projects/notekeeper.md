NoteKeeper was an experiment in creating a notekeeping application with a focus on privacy. 
It was designed as an Electron application with a backend written in Go.
The [frontend](https://github.com/farrcraft/notekeeper-electron-frontend) was built with Typescript, React, and Electron.
It communicated with the [backend](https://github.com/farrcraft/notekeeper-electron-backend) using Google Protobufs.
