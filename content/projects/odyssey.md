Odyssey is my game engine development playground. It is written in modern C++.
While there is some functional overlap with Vertical 3D, I wanted a green space to experiment.
I originally learned C++ in the mid-90's which informs a lot of the older Vertical 3D code and its patterns. It wasn't designed primarily as a game engine either.
