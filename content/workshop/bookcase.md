A simple large bookcase custom designed to maximise shelf space in a specific room corner.

My wife and I have way too many books.  We had unpacked boxes of books from before we moved and the piles of new books just kept growing.  Rather than cull the collection, I figured why not throw together a new giant bookcase to store them all.  I whipped up a quick [Fusion 360 Drawing](/workshop/pdf/bookcase-drawing-v1.pdf) for a basic plywood bookcase.  It was designed to fit a specific room space and maximise shelf space.  There are fixed shelves to support the large structure as well as shelves supported with adjustable shelf pins.  The adjustable shelves help optimize to fit the maximum number of shelves based on book heights.  All of the front edges were treated with iron on edge banding. Then it was all finished with a black paint with an HVLP application.
