A set of hanging shelves in the shape of a coffin constructed entirely from reclaimed wood.

This build was a request from my wife based on some she'd seen on "the Insta" or some other such social media channel.
With a stack of scrap reclaimed wood to get rid of and a challenge, I dove in.

These are old planks of mostly Douglas Fir, some of them in worse shape than others.  They were recovered during remodeling on our 1949-built PNW home.

These planks with their shiplap edges were originally primarily used as either a wall cladding or sub flooring material.

The rough material gets run through the planer, jointer, and table saw to transform into something vaguely resembling useful stock.

It's the "blue tape clamp trick" minus the blue.  Seriously though, tape is a great hack for holding miter joints tight during assembly.

Things are starting to look coffin-shaped now.

Real clamps jump in to give our tape clamps some support along the other axis.
