There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Every woodworker has to make at least one cutting board in their career.  This is my first and the one that I take up space with on my kitchen counter.  I made it from the same Hard Maple that I used for the [Kitchen Island](/workshop/kithen-island/).  It has grooves carved out on the sides for picking it up and rubber feet screwed into the bottom to keep it secure on the counter surface.
