A large fancy-looking dining room table constructed from basic big box store materials.
<!--more-->
This was a fairly early project in my woodworking career. I found the plans on one of the many DIY blogs that feature these kinds of budget Restoration Hardware style pieces. The material is all standard cheap big box store material - 2x4's, 4x4's, and pine boards. The joinery is pocket hole screws and biscuits.
