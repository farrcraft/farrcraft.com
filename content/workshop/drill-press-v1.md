A first pass at a benchtop drill press stand.
<!--more-->

I needed a place for my Jet drill press to live along with some additional storage.  I also knew I had some scrap 2x4 and 2x6 boards leftover from another project that I could make use of.  Along with the specific storage container, there was an additional design constraint of needing to fit within a rolling base platform.

Starting with mocking things up in software is always a good idea when possible.  By designing the structure out in Sketch Up first, I could better visualize both the scale and the joinery.

With a context roughed out in the virtual, I could start to rough it out in the real to work out the final dimensions.

My pre-viz work gave me a good idea of how half-lap joinery would fit in this project.  I've carried that forward into the actual parts.

The sides are done and attached using pocket hole technology.  All that's left is the top which is just 2x6 boards and more pocket holes.
