A kitchen island? Functional furniture of some form or another.  Solid Maple butcher block style top with lots of storage options built in.

There is an area in my kitchen (the "nook") that I've never been able to solve. Should there be a table, an island, built in bench seating, or outside-facing bar seats? This is the result of the island attempt (spoiler - it wasn't the solution).  I found the plans for this one off of a DIY blog somewhere.  The carcasse and drawer construction is plywood.  Joinery is pocket hole screws and brad nails.  The trim work is made from strips of Pine and Douglass Fir scrap.  Finished with latex paint (thinned and sprayed through an HVLP turbine).  The top is made from Hard Maple in a 2-part butcher block style method and finished with food-safe mineral oil.
