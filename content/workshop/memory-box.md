This is a small wooden box made from Figured Maple and Black Walnut.
<!--more-->

  This is a sentimental piece made to hold a former pet's dog collar on the mantle.  The Black Walnut pieces were resawn from thicker stock on the bandsaw.  The outer Maple box with the Black Walnut top/bottom is constructed first as a single assembly.  The lid is then cut out from the box and the Black Walnut wall liner pieces are added. This liner also provides the lip that the top attaches onto.  The finish is a simple BLO (Boiled Linseed Oil) application.
