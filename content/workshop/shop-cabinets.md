Critical shop infrastructure. Drawers! Doors! Horizontal surfaces!  It's got it all!
<!--more-->
The shop cabinets are based on the [Miter Station plans](https://thewoodwhispererguild.com/product/miter-station/) from The Wood Whisperer with only minor modifications. I needed to build one fewer cabinet to fit my space. I finished the top with sheets of black laminate (glued down with Super 77) to match my router table, omitted the t-tracks and used poplar for the edge banding.  The drawer faces are made from scraps of reclaimed pine from a set of old built-in shelving in my basement. Since my miter saw has an obnoxious footprint, I mounted the shelf on drawer slides so that it can store more compactly when I'm not using it.
