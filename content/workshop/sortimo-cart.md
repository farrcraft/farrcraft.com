Because your sorting system also needs a sorting system. This is a simple box on casters designed to fit a specific corner of the shop.

Over my time making I've accumulated a lot of different "hardware". Nuts, bolts, washers, screws, assorted mechanical fasteners, electrical connectors and components. All sorts of the different bits and bobs you pick up from project to project along with all your normal staples (and actual staples too probably). Once I got tired of just a mess of parts boxes inside of cabinet drawers, I decided that part of the solution was to switch to some sort of compartmentalized storage bins.  I eventually settled on the Husky Home Depot brand of bins.  They're not too expensive (especially compared to actual Sortimo containers) and easily available to me.  These types of containers are amazing. They're nicely sealed with latches (sometimes to waterproof standards), there are lots of individual compartments (sometimes configurable or even entirely removable), and transparent (ish) plastic so you can see the contents without having to open the container.

They're also designed so that they nicely stack. If you thought this went into the "pro" column, wait until you have a dozen stacked up and you need the one on the bottom.  This is why I made this cart.  The rails support each container so they're easy to remove individually.  The size is designed to fit the size of space I had available for it and the dimensions of the containers I've settled on using.  I included casters in the design to make it easy to move if necessary (including just being able to move it into the space it was designed for).  The carcasse and rails are all made from plywood.  The rails are secured with 18ga brad nails where there was room.  The inner rails are attached with countersunk drywall screws (the impact ratchet paid for itself that day).

Here is the [Sortimo Cabinet Drawing](/workshop/pdf/sortimo-cabinet-drawing-v1.pdf) that was created in Autodesk Fusion 360.
