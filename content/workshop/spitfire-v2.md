When I was a teenager way back in the early '90's, I came to learn how to fly RC airplanes as a hobby.  I put a basic "trainer" plane - not much more than a large styrofoam wing attached with rubberbands to a basic fiberglass and aluminum body - through more than one crash landing and rebuild until I was confident enough to fly unassisted and eventually ready to upgrade to a "real" plane.  Of the many options to choose from, I've always been a fan of the visual aesthetics of the Britain's WWII-era Supermarine Spitfire series of planes.  I was able to acquire a kit for such a war bird at my local hobby shop at the time.  The kit - from a now-defunct company by the name of Pica - promised the parts to build a complete 1/6 scale Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX.  Back in those days, kits tended to be much more involved compared to the wealth of almost ready to fly models that are on the market today.  The Pica kit consisted largely of a set of scale plans, a set of step by step instructions and a box of balsa wood parts.  The full set of listed steps is somewhere around at least 200 steps making for quite an involved build.
