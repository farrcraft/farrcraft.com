Pictured above, an earlier iteration of one of the sides of my workshop featuring my original table saw.  The following is the state of my garage shop since then, circa March 2019.
<!--more-->

  It is not quite a full size 2 car garage at around 19' deep by 17' wide.  It still needs to fit one parked car when not being used.  This means that most tools are on wheels so they can be moved around and stored along the sides when not in use.  Also, the garage door wall has to remain clear for car ingress and egress.


## South Wall

Miter station cabinets, drill press, router table, and a clamp rack centered between the windows.  While the windows provide some extra natural light, they also limit the amount of usable wall space.  The cabinets give me lots of extra storage space, but the drill press and tool chest take up a lot of the footprint of the counter surfaces.  They also suffer from a general condition of horizontal surface-itus.


## East Wall

Workbench and lumber rack against the wall.  A Wen dust filter / air circulator hangs from the ceiling in the middle of the garage.  The enclosed upper wall cabinet in the corner is used for storing paints, solvents, and other finishing supplies.  The lower portion of the corner serves as a general corner of misery for piling up other bits of scrap.


## North Wall

Table saw, jointer, planer, bandsaw, dust collector.
