Simple, yet delicious. Slice a pork tenderloin on a steep bias into 3 or 4 pieces. Pound each chunk into a large uniformly thin piece, around 1/4&amp;quot; thick. Traditional 3 step breading station - flour, cayenne, salt &amp;amp; pepper followed by egg and finished with panko bread crumbs. Shallow fry for 2-3 minutes per side. Serve on a basic bun - I chose a pub-style bun, which is almost too fancy - simpler really is better for this one.</description></item><item><title>Avocado - Guacamole</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-50-avocado/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-50-avocado/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Baking - Baked Manicotti</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-24-baking-baked-manicotti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-24-baking-baked-manicotti/</guid><description>Baked Manicotti.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a little snack to start things off. I kept the tapenade vegetarian and added a splash of soy sauce as a sad attempt to compensate for the lack of anchovies. If I&amp;rsquo;d had marmite, that might have worked too. As a cruel joke, the feta is not vegetarian, having animal rennet in its ingredient list.
Just before making the tapenade, I was using the food processor to make hot sauce.</description></item><item><title>British - Bangers &amp; Mash</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-15-british/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-15-british/</guid><description>Recipe roughly from - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/bangers-and-mash-with-onion-gravy-recipe.html Didn&amp;rsquo;t have regular milk for the potatoes.

I used 1/2# of dried pinto beans, soaked overnight. Divided into a smaller vegetarian batch using water (didn&amp;rsquo;t have any vegetable broth on hand) and a larger batch using pancetta and chicken stock (1c super gelatinous homemade stock and 1c store-bought low sodium broth).
The first time I tried making these back in July, I put them in the smoker with a pork butt at 225F. The beans were in the smoker around 9 hours.</description></item><item><title>Southern - Fried Chicken + Sides</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-14-southern/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-14-southern/</guid><description>Southern Fried Chicken - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe.html Hushpuppies &amp;amp; Remoulade - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/03/buttermilk-hushpuppies-remoulade-recipe.html BBQ Beans - http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/the-best-barbecue-beans-quick-and-slow-cooked.html Deli Slaw - http://amazingribs.com/recipes/slaws_salads_and_other_vegetables/creamy_coleslaw_with_sour_cream.html Asparagus &amp;amp; Hollandaise - http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/04/foolproof-2-minute-hollandaise-recipe.html Macaroni Salad - No recipe.

I was surprised at how strongly the smoked tea flavor came through even with the sauce. They were really good with a really unique flavor, but for the hassle of all of the smoke in the kitchen, I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d do this again outside of a special occasion.
I have one of those awful under oven broiler drawers and did around 5 minutes on each side to finish before tossing in the remaining sauce.</description></item><item><title>Tex-Mex - Enchiladas Combination Platter</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-5-tex-mex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-5-tex-mex/</guid><description>(Un)Finished plate first. Your standard enchiladas combination platter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made the rice and beans several times before and they&amp;rsquo;re just the way I like them. This was my first time with this particular enchilada recipe. I really liked it overall, but would make some small tweaks next time.
The base sauce is pretty similar to how I usually do it, though i don&amp;rsquo;t typically add the roux and tend to keep it vegetarian without adding the beef.</description></item><item><title>Thai - Chicken Satay &amp; Dipping Sauce</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-22-thai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2017/week-22-thai/</guid><description>Almost turned into a complete failure when one leg of my preheated Weber charcoal grill collapsed and the whole thing overturned in the yard.
