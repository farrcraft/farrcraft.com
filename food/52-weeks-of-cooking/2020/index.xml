It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty straightforward construction. For the tenderloin: cut about 1/4# of pork tenderloin, butterfly it, pound it out to about 1/4&amp;quot; thick, standard 3 part breading (seasoned flour, egg, panko bread crumbs), and shallow fry a couple minutes per side. For the sandwich: soft bun, mayo, mustard, iceberg, pickles, tomatoes, onion.</description></item><item><title>Australasian - Halal Snack Pack</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-25-australasian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-25-australasian/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s just a Jackson Pollock of awesome bad food.

There were some good crunchy darker ones, but there were a good percentage that were under done.

First up, Cucumber Gazpacho: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cucumber-tomatillo-gazpacho This is an interesting one. At first it tasted really good, but after a few bites it got really hard to keep eating. It has a very aggressive flavor profile that I don&amp;rsquo;t think makes it work for a main dish. It would be fine as a small starter portion or as sauce served alongside something else (like maybe pork tenderloin).</description></item><item><title>Deep Frying - Hush Puppies / Chimichangas</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-13-deep-frying/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-13-deep-frying/</guid><description>Hush Puppies

The most important part is the 3:1 ratio of vinegar &amp;amp; oil. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be an exact fussy measurement. I start with vinegar, 2 parts neutral oil, 1 part olive oil. The oil will float on top, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to eyeball the amount.</description></item><item><title>Fermented - Kimchi Fried Chicken/Tofu Sandwich</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-10-fermented/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-10-fermented/</guid><description>Kenji&amp;rsquo;s Recipe - https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/07/kimchi-fried-chicken-sandwich.html
This is a fun take on fried chicken and of course delicious - it&amp;rsquo;s fried chicken, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be? The combination of red chili glaze and the spice mix sprinkled on after frying makes this extra spicy. Some people in the recipe comments complained about ROI based on the amount of effort to make it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was terribly more involved than making regular fried chicken.</description></item><item><title>Finnish - Korvapuusti (Cinnamon Buns)</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-32-finnish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-32-finnish/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to bother with plating and presentation.

I thought these were going to be a fail. The dough seemed way too sticky and I just kept adding more flour while the mixer continued to knead. Also the oil I was frying in was pretty shallow. Despite all of that, they&amp;rsquo;re actually just ok. Maybe a little chewier and unevenly cooked in some spots than ideal, but even a bad doughnut is still a doughnut.</description></item><item><title>Food in Disguise - Vegan Chicken &amp; Waffles</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-33-food-in-disguise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-33-food-in-disguise/</guid><description>Source: https://www.rabbitandwolves.com/vegan-chicken-and-waffles-with-spicy-maple-syrup/
I tend to find vegan cooking to be very idiosyncratic or maybe even esoteric with a lot of recipe constructions compared to their non-vegan counterparts. This pair is no exception with its huge amount of cornstarch, ground flax seeds, and vinegar curdled almond milk.
Despite the deep frying, a lot of the excessive cornstarch coating on the chickpea fritters stayed as white flakes. Flavor-wise, they&amp;rsquo;re actually pretty good - crispy outside, but still light and fluffy on the inside - not too dense or too crunchy.</description></item><item><title>From Scratch - Fettuccine with Pork Meatball Sugo</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-17-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-17-from-scratch/</guid><description>Homemade noodles and a slow simmered sugo with pork sausage meatballs made from home ground pork shoulder.

I started with the marinade from this recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/08/jerk-chicken.html Chicken thighs and pressed extra firm tofu were marinated (separately) overnight in vacuum sealed bags. The chicken was sous vide for 3 hours @ 165F and the tofu for 2 hours @ 180F. They were both finished in a cast iron pan in the Ooni Pro for a few minutes.

This is primarily the recipe I followed - https://umamigirl.com/easy-vegetarian-ramen/
I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across a lot of vegetarian ramen broths and I&amp;rsquo;m not extremely versed in what qualifies as good/bad/authentic ramen. Despite some minor execution miscalculations, I thought this was really quite tasty, though. Blending the rehydrated mushrooms with the stock makes for a rich and creamy broth - I don&amp;rsquo;t even think it necessarily needs the extra pat of butter at the end.</description></item><item><title>Nepalese - Momos &amp; Chow Mein</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-22-nepalese/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-22-nepalese/</guid><description>Based on recipes from:

Not perfectly shaped, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t fuss too much trying to get them formed. The recipe says 12-15, but I think I ended up with 23. I used sushi rice as recommended and cooked it in the pressure cooker. The only deviation from the recipe was to keep them vegetarian, replacing chicken for vegetable stock and omitting the gelatin. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find the lack of gelatin to end up being a problem and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any need to substitute an alternative thickener.</description></item><item><title>Russian - Beef Stroganoff, Blinis, Kvass</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-3-russian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/food/52-weeks-of-cooking/2020/week-3-russian/</guid><description>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning on this dish since I remembered doing it in a previous one (2012 Week 13 - it&amp;rsquo;s been a while), but with leftover egg noodles from a few weeks ago and a Sam the Cooking Guy video popping up in my feed, the universe nudged me into it.
