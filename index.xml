I started with CVS, moved on to SVN for a good long while, and was finally converted over to Git long after it had achieved its critical mass. I had a sourceforge account (which I loved) long before it became the reviled product it is today, flirted for a bit with beanstalk, and now use github in its public and private forms on a daily basis.</description></item><item><title>Pressing Matters</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2015/08/10/pressing-matters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 06:50:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2015/08/10/pressing-matters/</guid><description>WordPress to Octopress and Back Again This site is once again running on WordPress. It’s been through many changes since its earliest incarnation as handwritten static HTML. There have been versions based on custom PHP frameworks, a pyblosxom-based variant, and most recently, the Octopress installation. Directly prior to Octopress, the site had already been using WordPress. So why did I leave and why did I come back?
What I don’t like about WordPress Its relative ease of installation and use for newcomers belies the big cumbersome application that WordPress really is underneath.</description></item><item><title>Vent Hood Build</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2015/08/09/vent-hood-build/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2015 17:40:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2015/08/09/vent-hood-build/</guid><description>When I originally built the electric brewery, it was located at the back of the garage in front of a window. During boils I would open the window and point a small fan from above the kettle to move steam outside. In our new house, the brewery got moved out of the garage and into its own space in the basement. This meant I would need a new ventilation system.</description></item><item><title>Holiday Poster Boards</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2015/08/07/holiday-poster-boards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 19:18:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2015/08/07/holiday-poster-boards/</guid><description>A while back [ok – headed toward 2 years ago now – I’m way behind on blog posts], Creative Market held a Christmas party, giving its employees and community members an opportunity to hang out and interact.

Some of the steps have a fixed duration. A 60 minute boil will never take any less time than an hour to complete. There’s no way around that fact. However, there are other areas with the potential to optimize and speed up the brew day.
When you optimize your own brew day look for ways not only to shorten the overall time spent brewing, but also to extract the most value from that time.</description></item><item><title>Keeping it Clean</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/keeping-it-clean/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 22:12:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/keeping-it-clean/</guid><description>Cleaning &amp;amp; sanitization Most of the time involved in beer making is a hands off process as the yeast does its work. A comparatively small portion of time is actively spent on preparing the yeast, wort and, later on, packaging the resulting beer. A good deal of any brewer’s hands on time is dedicated to cleaning and sanitizing tasks. So what is the difference between the two processes and when is each appropriate?</description></item><item><title>10 Essential Brew Day Terms Defined</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/10-essential-brew-day-terms-defined/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2012 22:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/10-essential-brew-day-terms-defined/</guid><description>Newcomers to the homebrewing world will quickly encounter a vast landscape of unfamiliar acronyms and bizarre terminology.

First, boiling sterilizes the beer, killing any unwanted bacteria that might be hanging around just waiting to spoil your hard work. Boil off reduces the overall volume, concentrating it. Without boiling, you’d end up with a beer that probably tasted water down. Boiling also causes caramelization, contributing additional flavor to the beer.</description></item><item><title>Beyond Extract Brewing Methods</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/beyond-extract-brewing-methods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2012 23:53:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/beyond-extract-brewing-methods/</guid><description>There is no question that award winning beers can be made using malt extract as the the basis of their recipe. However, when using extracts, much of the work in converting the grain’s starches into usable sugars has already been done for the brewer. This also means that much of the control over the end product is in the hands of the extract producers and not the brewer. By using all grain and leaving malt extracts behind, brewers can take more control over the flavor profiles of the beers they are creating.</description></item><item><title>Extract Brewing Methods</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/extract-brewing-methods/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 01:23:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/extract-brewing-methods/</guid><description>There may be almost as many ways to make beer as there are different styles of beer. While the basic formula is to combine a hoppy sugary liquid with yeast to ultimately produce a fermented beverage, the steps to get there can vary greatly. These different approaches also tend to affect brewing process, equipment and the ingredients that are required.

Measuring, monitoring and ultimately, controlling temperature is a key aspect of producing quality beer. It starts with making sure that the water is being heated to the correct temperature for mashing and later on for sparging. It continues with getting the boiled wort cooled down to an appropriate temperature to pitch the yeast. After fermentation and carbonation, the beer needs to be cooled down to the correct serving temperature.</description></item><item><title>A Beer Style Primer</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/introduction-styles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2012 06:40:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/introduction-styles/</guid><description>Beers are typically categorized by their style. Styles are primarily defined by characteristics such as color, bitterness, alcohol content, ingredients, aroma, body, mouthfeel and flavor. They also often carry particular historical and regional significance. For instance, the Berliner Weisse began as a regional specialty style of Berlin while Munich Helles was first created in Munich.
While beers have probably been categorized into different styles based on their differing properties for as long as they have been brewed, it is possibly the acclaimed English beer writer Michael Jackson who pioneered modern beer style definitions with his 1977 book “The World Guide To Beer”.</description></item><item><title>Full Steam Ahead</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/08/19/full-steam-ahead/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/08/19/full-steam-ahead/</guid><description>I made my first steam beer about six months ago. It was my first brew of the year (not counting mead) and my first attempt at coming up with my own recipe. While there were a number of milestones that came with that brew, I wasn’t all that thrilled with the resulting beer. It wasn’t bad, but try as I might, I just could never find anything particularly noteworthy about it.</description></item><item><title>The Mayan</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/08/15/the-mayan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/08/15/the-mayan/</guid><description>The brewing process for me often starts with a simple concept or core thematic element. It could be an ingredient, a style, or some other idea serving as the inspiration for the beer. In this case a recent thread in the HBT forums brought up the idea of an end of the world brew.

My last attempt was a golden strong ale called Blonde Bombshell.
It was also my second brewing experience ever. In the intervening time my knowledge and process has changed significantly.
I’ve gone from brewing partial-boil extract recipes taken from the internet to all-grain full-boil batches created from my own custom designed recipes. Regardless my advances, I’m always finding areas of my techniques and processes to improve upon from one session to the next.</description></item><item><title>Cherry Wheat</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/05/20/cherry-wheat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/05/20/cherry-wheat/</guid><description>As I’ve slowly worked my way through various new styles and ingredients to experiment with, fruit has long been on my list. I’ve been looking forward to making a beer featuring cherries for nearly a year now. The idea first came to me after seeing fresh ripe cherries at a local farmers market one weekend.

One of my favorite batches to date has been my Strong Scotch Ale all-grain recipe. One of the signature characteristics of most Scottish ales is a deep, rich malt profile.

When I initially started writing I had four primary concepts in mind – a blend of food, beer, travel, and photography.

I’m kicking off the 2011 brewing season with what I had anticipated on being my last brew of 2010. I was hoping to get this brew in before the end of the year. Unfortunately, an order shipment delay from MoreBeer followed by a month long chest cold and a grain mill debacle added up to a two month brewing hiatus.
Instead of my usual internet recipe search, I’ve decided to take another big step and develop my own recipe.</description></item><item><title>Razzmatazz</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/02/07/razzmatazz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2011/02/07/razzmatazz/</guid><description>I’ve been wanting to branch out from beer and try my hand at brewing mead for quite a while. Other than the suggestion that a fermented alcoholic beverage made from honey and fruit sounds delicious, I really don’t know what I’m getting into.

It’s time for a new recipe and all new mistakes. This is batch #2 on my v3.0 brewing system – ninth overall since I started home brewing and the fifth all-grain.

My goal with each new batch of beer is to do something I’ve never done before. I use this experimentation as a way explore and learn about the world of beer and brewing. There are usually several new things that I introduce each time I brew, but overall I try to limit the variables to a small extent in order to help me understand the role that each one plays.</description></item><item><title>Valentine’s Edition Brew Day – Bell’s Two Hearted Ale</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2010/02/19/valentines-edition-brew-day-bells-two-hearted-ale/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2010/02/19/valentines-edition-brew-day-bells-two-hearted-ale/</guid><description>So, technically, the brew was on the day after Valentine’s Day (or as it is affectionately known around the house since it coincides with the Chinese New Year, Loony FatChoyintine’s Day). The ingredients were sourced on the most special of holidays, though.
Bell’s Two Hearted Ale is an IPA brewed by Bell’s out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Unfortunately, it isn’t available on the west coast. My first introduction to it was through a visit to the Patton Alley Pub during my vacation back home in Springfield, Missouri.</description></item><item><title>Game Time Grub – Hot Wings</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2010/02/07/game-time-grub-hot-wings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2010/02/07/game-time-grub-hot-wings/</guid><description>These are hands down, the best wings I’ve ever made. Never mind that the recipe was hastily hacked together from multiple online recipe sources and only used as a rough guideline once in the kitchen. And don’t even think of bringing up the fact that I’m basing this on a sample size of one and have never actually made hot wings before. Caveats in mind, here it is.

When it came time for renewal, I decided to make the switch
over to Flickr. In my year with Smugmug I had uploaded somewhere around 1500 photos. It would be no easy task to
migrate this number of images between services while maintaining their organization and associated metadata. So why do it and is it really worth it?
The target audience of Smugmug seems to be professional photographers.</description></item><item><title>The Belgian Blonde</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2009/12/22/the-belgian-blonde/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2009/12/22/the-belgian-blonde/</guid><description>This is my second batch of craft home brewed beer. When I set out to pick the recipe this time around I had several goals in mind. Based on my experiences the first time, I knew I wanted to expand on the knowledge and techniques I had used so far. It needed to be an even bigger beer. Instead of using dry yeast it had to be a liquid variety and use a proper starter.</description></item><item><title>Black/White</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/07/06/blackwhite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/07/06/blackwhite/</guid><description>The end of June marks the end of the first half of a year in pictures. It also signifies the end of a month-long experiment in black &amp;amp; white photography for my 365 project. I’ve never really appreciated working in the B&amp;amp;W format. If anything, I prefer to treat my images with a dialed down vibrance setting (a control available in Adobe Lightroom which applies a much smarter algorithmic approach to desaturation) in order to mute colors without removing them completely.</description></item><item><title>Brewcraft</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2009/06/14/brewcraft/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/homebrewing/2009/06/14/brewcraft/</guid><description>My homebrew adventure began with a trip to the local supply shop, San Francisco Brewcraft.
After a few weeks of internet research I had a pretty good idea of what I needed to get started. Most of the necessary equipment is typically
packaged up into custom kits sold by just about every brewing store around. I settled on a mid-range kit composed of a 6.5 gallon plastic primary fermenting bucket (with spigot), 5 gallon glass carboy secondary fermenter, stoppers, airlocks, cleaning brushes, hose, funnel, bottle caps and capper, auto-siphon, hydrometer, and the ingredients for the first batch of beer.</description></item><item><title>The Mother Road</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/06/01/the-mother-road/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/06/01/the-mother-road/</guid><description>At the end of April, I took a bit of vacation time and spent five days driving from San Francisco, CA to my hometown of Springfield, MO. While large portions of the journey were spent mindlessly blazing down the interstate on autopilot, some sections were devoted to sightseeing along the historic Route 66. The 2300 mile adventure was a trip back through eras long past.

This post has been sitting as a draft for a few months now. It’s about time it finally got polished up and published.
I kept a short journal of the first few days of my vacation in Mexico near the small fishing village of Teacapan. This is how it starts…

February was filled with rainy days. It’s a fact that can be evidenced by the large number of shots of (mostly) inanimate household objects. The limited opportunities for shooting excursions often challenged me to find interesting material in my local environment.
There was also ample occasion for pushing my post processing knowledge as well as continuing to develop my skills behind the lens.</description></item><item><title>Pillow Talk</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/02/19/pillow-talk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/02/19/pillow-talk/</guid><description>Almost everyone has hated Valentine’s Day at one time or another in their life. It’s most likely out of these deep feelings of love scorned masked by a disdain for corporate holidays that the great Pillow Fight was borne. This year marked the fourth anniversary of the San Francisco Pillow Fight. The rules were simple. You should bring a pillow to the Justin Herman Plaza at the Embarcadero in San Francisco on Valentine’s Day.</description></item><item><title>Year of the Ox</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/02/16/year-of-the-ox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/02/16/year-of-the-ox/</guid><description>The Chinese New Year Parade was started sometime in the 1860’s and remains one of the few night illuminated parades in the country.

I picked up my first dSLR camera kit – the Canon Digital Rebel XTi – in April of 2008. Since then I’ve already acquired various new lenses and other essential photo gear. Most recently I upgraded to the Canon 5D Mark II camera body. With a shooting capacity of around 400 RAW images on a 4GB card, the XTi was a great place to start with learning the photography basics.</description></item><item><title>The Big Damn Lie</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/01/28/the-big-damn-lie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/blog/2009/01/28/the-big-damn-lie/</guid><description>Vermillion Lies with Reverend Peyton’s Big Damn Band The Great American Music Hall Thursday, January 22nd, 2009
Established in 1907, The Great American Music Hall is San Francisco’s oldest nightclub.

Also in the area adjacent to this sidewalk were said to be the ruins of an old brick factory. Having recently acquired my upgraded camera body, this seemed a perfect location to break it in.

The more stuff you have, the more space you need to keep it). This was a quick weekend project with a bit of scrap plywood, an idea, and not much else of a plan. I did a bit of online searching to get some ideas of form factors and inspiration and then headed into the shop to make a mess.</description></item><item><title>Cutting Board</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cutting-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cutting-board/</guid><description>Every woodworker has to make at least one cutting board in their career.

Over 2+ decades, you develop some portfolio cruft. These are some of the bits and bobs that I&amp;rsquo;ve toiled and tinkered with over the years.

I found the plans on one of the many DIY blogs that feature these kinds of budget Restoration Hardware style pieces. The material is all standard cheap big box store material - 2x4&amp;rsquo;s, 4x4&amp;rsquo;s, and pine boards.

They were both born of the same set of frustrations and focus on improving shop organization and functionality. In both cases, tools were taking up otherwise valuable real estate and in a way that made them difficult or less safe to use. I also had the opportunity to consolidate storage spaces based on function. Here, I could keep everything related to drilling holes all in one place.</description></item><item><title>Kitchen Island</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-island/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-island/</guid><description>There is an area in my kitchen (the &amp;ldquo;nook&amp;rdquo;) that I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to solve. Should there be a table, an island, built in bench seating, or outside-facing bar seats? This is the result of the island attempt (spoiler - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the solution). I found the plans for this one off of a DIY blog somewhere. The carcasse and drawer construction is plywood.

Primarily, I had a growing stockpile of reclaimed material I wanted to use up. Additionally I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time front-loading the design of the project. I knew I wanted to build a low chest of drawers and worked out an initial set of dimensions (2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo;x4&amp;rsquo;). The rest of it, I would work out organically as the build went along.</description></item><item><title>Memory Box</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/memory-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/memory-box/</guid><description>This small wooden box is made from Figured Maple and Black Walnut.

They&amp;rsquo;re both benchtop models on the cheaper end of the spectrum (Chinese import tool company Wen - for my limited hobby use, they make some surprisingly decent lower budget tools). Originally I just made space for them on the counter tops, but that was never an ideal solution.
I had essentially 3 problems:
I have two different sanding machines taking up a lot of real estate on my cabinet counters They&amp;rsquo;re difficult to access and use both safely and ergonomically All of my sanding tools and materials are scattered around the shop The answer to all of these was to build this new sanding station.</description></item><item><title>Shop Cabinets</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/shop-cabinets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/shop-cabinets/</guid><description>The shop cabinets are based on the Miter Station plans from The Wood Whisperer with only minor modifications. I needed to build one fewer cabinet to fit my space. I finished the top with sheets of black laminate (glued down with Super 77) to match my router table, omitted the t-tracks and used poplar for the edge banding.

All sorts of the different bits and bobs you pick up from project to project along with all your normal staples (and actual staples too probably).
