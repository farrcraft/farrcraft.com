Measuring, monitoring and ultimately, controlling temperature is a key aspect of producing quality beer. It starts with making sure that the water is being heated to the correct temperature for mashing and later on for sparging. It continues with gettingÂ the boiled wort cooled down to an appropriate temperature to pitch the yeast. After fermentation and carbonation, the beer needs to be cooled down to the correct serving temperature.</description></item></channel></rss>
