This piece is 4&amp;rsquo; long by something wide.
I cut two strips, one around 9&amp;quot; wide and the other about 3&amp;quot; wide.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a large selection to work with on hand. 5/8&amp;quot; spax screws were the best I could come up with of what I already had.
The circular saw rides on top of the larger piece and runs against the edge of the smaller strip.</description></item><item><title>Cordless Station</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cordless-station/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cordless-station/</guid><description>Once I accumulated enough cordless tools*, I needed a centralized place to store them all (That reminds me of a classic George Carlin bit about &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;. The more stuff you have, the more space you need to keep it). This was a quick weekend project with a bit of scrap plywood, an idea, and not much else of a plan. I did a bit of online searching to get some ideas of form factors and inspiration and then headed into the shop to make a mess.</description></item><item><title>Cutting Board</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cutting-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/cutting-board/</guid><description>Every woodworker has to make at least one cutting board in their career. This is my first and the one that I take up space with on my kitchen counter. I made it from the same Hard Maple that I used for the Kitchen Island. It has grooves carved out on the sides for picking it up and rubber feet screwed into the bottom to keep it secure on the counter surface.</description></item><item><title>Dining Room Table</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/dining-room-table/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/dining-room-table/</guid><description>This was a fairly early project in my woodworking career. I found the plans on one of the many DIY blogs that feature these kinds of budget Restoration Hardware style pieces. The material is all standard cheap big box store material - 2x4&amp;rsquo;s, 4x4&amp;rsquo;s, and pine boards. The joinery is pocket hole screws and biscuits.</description></item><item><title>Drill Press Stand</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/drill-press-stand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/drill-press-stand/</guid><description>The drill press stand came about at the same time as the sanding station. They were both born of the same set of frustrations and focus on improving shop organization and functionality. In both cases, tools were taking up otherwise valuable real estate and in a way that made them difficult or less safe to use. I also had the opportunity to consolidate storage spaces based on function. Here, I could keep everything related to drilling holes all in one place.</description></item><item><title>Home Theater Speakers</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/ht-speakers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/ht-speakers/</guid><description>As part of a larger basement &amp;ldquo;Home Theater&amp;rdquo; project, I&amp;rsquo;m also custom building the speakers for the surround sound system. These are the first 4 of 6 in total (It will ultimately be a Dolby Atmos 5.1.4 setup, but the 4 height speakers are just a basic ceiling mounted model).
They&amp;rsquo;re all (except for the sub) based on a series of DIY speaker designs called &amp;ldquo;Statements&amp;rdquo; found here - http://www.speakerdesignworks.com/index_page_2.html The lineup here includes a pair of Micro Statements for the surround channels, and the Statement Center Channel.</description></item><item><title>Kitchen Island</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-island/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-island/</guid><description>There is an area in my kitchen (the &amp;ldquo;nook&amp;rdquo;) that I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to solve. Should there be a table, an island, built in bench seating, or outside-facing bar seats? This is the result of the island attempt (spoiler - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the solution). I found the plans for this one off of a DIY blog somewhere. The carcasse and drawer construction is plywood. Joinery is pocket hole screws and brad nails.</description></item><item><title>Kitchen Remodel</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-remodel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kitchen-remodel/</guid><description>3D Viz is one of the crucial up front planning phases of the project. I spend much of my time in Autodesk Fusion 360 mocking up assemblies like this base cabinet. It lets me work through how all of the pieces interact and should be assembled before actually working with any of the materials.
Everything is modeled with the amount of detail exactly as it would exist in the real world.</description></item><item><title>Kumiko Chest</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kumiko-chest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/kumiko-chest/</guid><description>I started this project with two initial goals. Primarily, I had a growing stockpile of reclaimed material I wanted to use up. Additionally I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time front-loading the design of the project. I knew I wanted to build a low chest of drawers and worked out an initial set of dimensions (2&amp;rsquo;x2&amp;rsquo;x4&amp;rsquo;). The rest of it, I would work out organically as the build went along.</description></item><item><title>Memory Box</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/memory-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/memory-box/</guid><description>This small wooden box is made from Figured Maple and Black Walnut. This is a sentimental piece made to hold a former pet&amp;rsquo;s dog collar on the mantle. The Black Walnut pieces were resawn from thicker stock on the bandsaw. The outer Maple box with the Black Walnut top/bottom is constructed first as a single assembly. The lid is then cut out from the box and the Black Walnut wall liner pieces are added.</description></item><item><title>Router Table</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/router-table/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/router-table/</guid><description>This was the first cabinetry project I ever built. I followed a set of fairly thorough plans I found for free online. The carcasse is constructed from plywood. The top consists of double laminated MDF topped with black laminate and edge banded with oak. The fence is also made from MDF. The small drawers slide on wooden rails while the bottom drawers use standard metal ball bearing drawer slides. The front access door is simple oak framed around a sheet of acrylic with a scrap piece of T-track to act as as door latch.</description></item><item><title>Sanding Station</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/sanding-station/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/sanding-station/</guid><description>I have two stationary sanding tools - an oscillating drum sander and a combination belt/disc sander. They&amp;rsquo;re both benchtop models on the cheaper end of the spectrum (Chinese import tool company Wen - for my limited hobby use, they make some surprisingly decent lower budget tools). Originally I just made space for them on the counter tops, but that was never an ideal solution.
I had essentially 3 problems:
I have two different sanding machines taking up a lot of real estate on my cabinet counters They&amp;rsquo;re difficult to access and use both safely and ergonomically All of my sanding tools and materials are scattered around the shop The answer to all of these was to build this new sanding station.</description></item><item><title>Shop Cabinets</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/shop-cabinets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/shop-cabinets/</guid><description>The shop cabinets are based on the Miter Station plans from The Wood Whisperer with only minor modifications. I needed to build one fewer cabinet to fit my space. I finished the top with sheets of black laminate (glued down with Super 77) to match my router table, omitted the t-tracks and used poplar for the edge banding. The drawer faces are made from scraps of reclaimed pine from a set of old built-in shelving in my basement.</description></item><item><title>Sortimo Cart</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/sortimo-cart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/sortimo-cart/</guid><description>Over my time making I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a lot of different &amp;ldquo;hardware&amp;rdquo;. Nuts, bolts, washers, screws, assorted mechanical fasteners, electrical connectors and components. All sorts of the different bits and bobs you pick up from project to project along with all your normal staples (and actual staples too probably). Once I got tired of just a mess of parts boxes inside of cabinet drawers, I decided that part of the solution was to switch to some sort of compartmentalized storage bins.</description></item><item><title>Table Saw Thin Strip Jig</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/thin-strip-jig/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/thin-strip-jig/</guid><description>This is a jig used for safely ripping thin boards on the table saw. Normally, if you try to setup to make a cut too narrow, the fence will be too close to the blade (and guard) to make a safe cut with a normal push stick. This simple jig works to offset the fence to be out of the way and provides a built-in pushing mechanism well away from the saw blade.</description></item><item><title>Workshop Tour - March 2019</title><link>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/workshop-tour-march-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://farrcraft.com/workshop/workshop-tour-march-2019/</guid><description>Pictured above, an earlier iteration of one of the sides of my workshop featuring my original table saw.
The following is the state of my garage shop since then, circa March 2019. It is not quite a full size 2 car garage at around 19&amp;rsquo; deep by 17&amp;rsquo; wide. It still needs to fit one parked car when not being used. This means that most tools are on wheels so they can be moved around and stored along the sides when not in use.</description></item></channel></rss>
